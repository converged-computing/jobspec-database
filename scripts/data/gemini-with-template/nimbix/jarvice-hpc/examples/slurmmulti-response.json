This is evident from the `#SBATCH` directives at the beginning of the script, which are specific to Slurm. \n* **software:** The script uses the following software:\n    * **python_ssh_test:** A Python script located at `/usr/local/JARVICE/tools/bin/python_ssh_test`, which seems to be involved in SSH-related tasks.\n    * **mpirun:** A command-line tool for launching and managing parallel programs across multiple nodes.\n* **modules:** The script doesn't explicitly load any modules, but it might rely on modules already loaded in the Slurm environment. \n* **environment_variables:**  The script doesn't explicitly set any environment variables. \n* **resources:** The script makes use of various Slurm resources, though their specific values are not defined in the script itself. The `#SBATCH` directives likely define these values.\n    * **nodes:** The `--hostfile` option of `mpirun` points to `/etc/JARVICE/nodes`, suggesting that the script will run across multiple nodes.\n    * **gres:** No specific `gres` resource is requested in the script.\n    * **cpus_per_task:** No specific `cpus_per_task` is defined in the script. \n    * **tasks:**  No specific number of tasks is defined in the script. \n    * **ntasks_per_node:** No specific number of tasks per node is defined in the script.\n    * **memory:** No specific memory requirements are defined in the script.\n* **versions:**  No specific software versions are explicitly defined in the script. \n\n**Important Note:** The script leverages Slurm features, making it necessary to interpret the `#SBATCH` directives to understand the resource usage and potentially the specific software versions. This information is not contained within the provided script itself. \n"
