This is indicated by the line `sbatch --array=${startix}-${endix} ${project_dir}/datasets/oulu-project/gigicar.job`.\n* **Software:** The script mentions a `matlab_work` directory, suggesting that MATLAB is involved in the workflow. While the script doesn't directly execute MATLAB commands, it likely submits jobs that utilize MATLAB within the `gigicar.job` file.\n* **Modules:** The script doesn't explicitly load any modules, but these are often handled within the `gigicar.job` file itself, depending on the cluster's configuration.\n* **Environment variables:** The script defines `project_dir` and `paths_file`, but it doesn't directly set any environment variables for the submitted jobs.\n* **Resources:**  The script utilizes `sbatch` to submit jobs with array indices, suggesting the use of SLURM's resource allocation features. The exact resource requirements would be defined within the `gigicar.job` file, such as CPU cores, memory, and time. The script's logic suggests that the job may be split into multiple tasks based on the number of lines in the `paths_file`.\n* **Versions:**  The script doesn't specify the versions of `sbatch`, MATLAB, or other software involved.\n\n**Note:**  This analysis is based on the script provided. To understand the complete resource and software requirements, you would need to examine the `gigicar.job` file and the cluster's configuration. \n"
