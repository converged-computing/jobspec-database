    "details": "This script utilizes a wide range of bioinformatics tools to perform quality control, variant calling, and analysis on Illumina sequencing data. The pipeline includes steps like adapter trimming, alignment, duplicate marking, variant calling using GATK, and filtering of variants. \n\nThe script utilizes a variety of modules: \n\n* Picard:  for converting FASTQ to SAM, marking Illumina adapters, validating SAM files, and marking duplicates.  \n* BWA:  for aligning reads to a reference genome.\n* SAMtools:  for converting SAM files to BAM files, sorting BAM files, and indexing BAM files.\n* GATK:  for variant calling (HaplotypeCaller) and combining gVCFs. \n* BEDTools:  for computing coverage.\n* DeepTools:  for computing coverage.\n\nThe script also utilizes several shell commands: \n\n* mkdir:  to create directories.\n* basename:  to extract filenames.\n* for loop:  to iterate over files.\n* module load:  to load modules.\n* time:  to measure the execution time of commands.\n\nThe script requires the following resources:\n\n* Nodes:  1\n* Processor cores:  1\n* Wall time:  120 hours\n* Memory:  200 GB\n* High-memory queue\n* Reference genome\n* Sequencing data (FASTQ or BAM files)",
