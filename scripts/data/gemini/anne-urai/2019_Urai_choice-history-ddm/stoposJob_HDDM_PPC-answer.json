    "application": "stopos",
    "details": "The script uses the 'stopos' module, likely a workload manager or resource scheduler, to run parallel jobs. It leverages the 'sara-get-num-cores' command to determine the number of cores available and then utilizes a loop to distribute jobs across these cores. The script also utilizes 'python27', suggesting it runs a Python 2.7 script for a model fitting task using the 'fitHDDM.py' script. Additionally, the script includes PBS directives for managing the job within a high-performance computing (HPC) environment like PBS (Portable Batch System) and relies on tools like 'mail' to notify the user about job completion."
