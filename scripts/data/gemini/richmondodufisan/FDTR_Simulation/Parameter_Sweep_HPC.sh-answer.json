    "details": "The script utilizes MOOSE, a finite element code, to simulate FDTR (Flash Diffusivity Thermal Reflectance) experiments. It manages parallel computations using MPI (Message Passing Interface) via the MPICH library and executes the simulation within a singularity container. The script interacts with the SLURM workload manager to submit and monitor batch jobs."
