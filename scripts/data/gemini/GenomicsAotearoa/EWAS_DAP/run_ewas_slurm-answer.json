        "This script uses Singularity to run an EWAS application, which appears to be a web-based tool for analyzing data.",
        "The script uses Apache as a web server and requires port forwarding from the submit node to the compute node for the web application to work properly.",
        "It configures Apache to listen on port 10083 and create a virtual directory for uploads/results.",
        "The script utilizes environment variables to configure EWAS and uses Slurm for job submission and resource allocation.",
        "The script requires several directories for data storage, including `uploads`, `results`, and `temp`."
