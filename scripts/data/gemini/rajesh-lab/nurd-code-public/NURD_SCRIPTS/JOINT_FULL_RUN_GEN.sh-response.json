It also includes options for running in different modes: \"print\" (prints the commands without executing), \"execute\" (executes the commands), and \"submit\" (submits the commands as a job to the batch scheduler).\n\n**Overall, the script is likely part of a machine learning research project involving chest X-ray analysis using the \"Nurd\" framework.** \n"
