    "details": "The script is using the SLURM workload manager to run the gemm_oblas.x application. It requests one node with 64 cores on the EPYC partition,  specifies a 2-hour runtime, and loads the AMD architecture, MKL, and OpenBLAS/0.3.21-omp modules. The script then uses the gemm_oblas.x application to perform a matrix multiplication operation, varying the number of OpenMP threads used from 1 to 64 and repeating the experiment 5 times for each thread count. The results are saved to a CSV file called blas_core_double.csv."
