It likely contains the actual training logic.\n\n* **Resources:**\n    * **partition:** The script is scheduled to run on the \"maxwell\" partition, which might indicate a set of machines dedicated to specific hardware or usage.\n    * **account:** The script is associated with the \"palmeri_gpu\" account, suggesting this is a user or group with access to GPU resources.\n    * **gres=gpu:4:** The script requests 4 GPUs for its execution.\n    * **nodes=1:**  The script runs on a single node (a computing server).\n    * **ntasks-per-node=12:** It uses 12 tasks (processes) per node.\n    * **mem=64G:** The script requires 64 GB of memory.\n    * **time=5-00:00:00:** The script is allocated a maximum runtime of 5 hours.\n    * **job-name=a_accre_train:** The job is given a descriptive name for easier identification.\n    * **output=/scratch/subravcr/trainedImagenet/myModels/xferLearning/a_accre_xfer_train_%A.out:** Output from the script is written to a file in the specified directory.\n    * **scratch_directory:**  The script uses \"/scratch/subravcr/trainedImagenet/myModels/xferLearning\" for storing data and model files.\n\nThe script likely trains a machine learning model (possibly related to image classification), using GPUs to accelerate the process. The \"a_accre_train.sh\" script likely contains the actual training logic. The \"baseNetToUse\" variable suggests that the script may be performing transfer learning, using a pre-trained network as a starting point. \n"
