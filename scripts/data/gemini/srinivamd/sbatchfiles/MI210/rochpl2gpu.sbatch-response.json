The script utilizes a Singularity container image to run the program, which is based on the **ROCm** (Radeon Open Compute) platform, and leverages MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing.\n\nThe script defines the following resources in the Slurm job submission:\n\n* **1 node**: Requests a single node on the cluster for the job to run.\n* **2 tasks per node**: Assigns 2 tasks to each node. \n* **16 CPUs per task**: Allocates 16 CPU cores to each task.\n* **128GB memory**: Sets a memory limit of 128 gigabytes for the job.\n* **2 GPUs**: Requests 2 GPUs for use by the job.\n\nThe script also utilizes the **module system** to load the necessary software packages and libraries, including:\n\n* **ROCm-5.4.2**: This is AMD's open software platform for GPUs.\n* **UCX-1.13.1**: A high-performance communication library that enables faster data transfer between nodes.\n* **OpenMPI 4.1.4**: A widely used MPI implementation for distributed computing.\n\nFinally, the script uses **Singularity** to run the program within a container image, which provides a consistent and portable environment for the software and its dependencies. The program itself is launched with the command `mpirun_rochpl`. This likely utilizes the **ROCm HPC Library (ROCHPL)** to run the program on the GPU resources.\n\nThe script sets up a temporary directory (`tmp=/tmp/$USER/tmp-$$`) for storing temporary files.\n\nIt's important to note that the script is very specific to the environment where it is intended to be run. It assumes a particular module system and specific paths to the relevant software packages. \n"
