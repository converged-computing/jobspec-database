    "script_description": "This script runs a MATLAB script to perform simulations for a Gomoku game, a game similar to tic-tac-toe but on a larger grid. It uses the SLURM job scheduler to manage the execution of multiple simulations across different data sets and models. Each simulation involves generating a specific number of players based on the data set and model selected. The script saves the results in a dedicated directory within the scratch directory. It also utilizes the `getbestx` function within MATLAB to calculate the best strategy for each player based on the specified data and model."
