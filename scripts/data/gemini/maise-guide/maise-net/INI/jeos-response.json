It requests one node, 16 cores, and the maximum memory per core available. It uses the \"main\" and \"long\" partitions, likely implying a requirement for extensive computational resources.\n    * **Files:**  The script manipulates several files related to VASP input and output:\n        * **INCAR:** Contains parameters for VASP calculations.\n        * **KPOINTS:** Defines the k-points for the Brillouin zone sampling.\n        * **POSCAR:** Contains the initial atomic positions.\n        * **CONTCAR:** Holds the final atomic positions.\n        * **OUTCAR:**  The main output file with information about the calculation.\n        * **OSZICAR:** Provides a summary of the calculation progress.\n        * **maisenet_kmsh.py:** This file seems to be a custom Python script used in conjunction with VASP.\n    * **Executables:**  The script relies on the VASP executable located at `/opt/ohpc/pub/apps/VASP/vasp.5.4.4/bin/vasp_std`.\n\n**Script Functionality:**\n\nThe script appears to execute VASP calculations multiple times with different settings, likely modifying the `NSW` (number of steps) parameter in the `INCAR` file to perform:\n\n1. **Relaxation steps:** Sets `NSW=20` to allow 20 steps of relaxation.\n2. **Static calculations:** Sets `NSW=0` to perform a single-point energy calculation.\n\nThe script then renames and copies the output files from each run, potentially for further analysis or comparison.  It also includes commands to clean up temporary files generated by VASP and the `maisenet_kmsh.py` script.\n\nThe script's overall purpose likely involves performing a series of VASP calculations to investigate a material's structure, electronic properties, or other quantities of interest. \n"
