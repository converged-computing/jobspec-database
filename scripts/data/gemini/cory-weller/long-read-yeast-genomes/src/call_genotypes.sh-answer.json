        "description": "The script utilizes Slurm for job scheduling and resource allocation. It utilizes several bioinformatics tools, including BWA for alignment, Samtools for manipulating alignment data, Mummer for aligning genomes, Python for custom scripts, and Parallel for parallelizing tasks. It performs the following steps:\n1. Copies required FASTA files to a temporary directory.\n2. Indexes the first strain's FASTA file using BWA.\n3. Performs chromosome-to-chromosome alignment using Mummer.\n4. Filters the SNP output from Mummer and generates a masked reference FASTA for BWA.\n5. Indexes the masked reference FASTA.\n6. Extracts a list of FASTQ files from the provided ZIP archive.\n7. Iterates over the FASTQ files, mapping reads to the masked reference using BWA, and calling genotypes using Bcftools.\n8. Combines and archives the genotype calls into a TAR.GZ file."
