It utilizes the following:\n\n**Software:**\n\n* **SLURM:**  The script leverages SLURM directives to manage job submission, resource allocation, and execution. \n* **OpenMPI:** The script indicates the use of OpenMPI, a message passing interface library, for parallel execution.\n* **OpenMP:**  While OpenMP is mentioned, it's unclear if it is actively used in this specific case.\n* **miniconda3:** The script sources the miniconda3 environment, indicating the use of Python and potentially other packages installed within it.\n* **wav2vec2:** The script explicitly specifies `wav2vec2` as the model used in the Python application.\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n* **Nodes:** The script requests one node.\n* **GPUs:** The script requests one GPU per node.\n* **CPUs:**  Although not explicitly stated, the script suggests limiting the number of CPUs per GPU to 32. This is likely a safety measure to prevent over-subscription of resources.\n* **Walltime:** The script requests one hour of walltime.\n* **Memory and Storage:**  These requirements are not specified in the script.\n\nThe script sets up a working environment, defines an application command, and executes it. \n\nNote: The script uses a `machine.file` which is not explicitly defined, but is likely a file containing the list of nodes allocated by SLURM. This file is essential for distributed execution with OpenMPI.\n"
