It uses SLURM for job scheduling, OpenMPI for parallel processing, and Miniconda3 for environment management. The script targets a cluster with AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs, ConnectX-6 network adapters, and A100 GPUs. The script requests resources such as GPUs, CPUs, memory, network, and storage. \n\nThe script utilizes SLURM directives to manage job parameters, including job name, project allocation, node and task allocation, GPU allocation, wallclock time, email notifications, and job requeue options. The script also sets up the environment with modules loaded for the basic environment, and configures environment variables such as OMP_NUM_THREADS for OpenMP threading.\n\nThe script defines the path to the application executable, sets the work directory, and determines the number of MPI tasks per node and in total. It then executes the command using either a pure OpenMP parallel program on a single node or an MPI code using OpenMPI. Finally, the script logs execution information, including the job ID, time, master node, current directory, and allocated nodes. \n"
