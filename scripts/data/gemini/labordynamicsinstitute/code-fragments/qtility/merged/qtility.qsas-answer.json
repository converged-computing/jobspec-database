    "SOFTWARE": "SAS",

        "PBS Pro queueing system",
        "SAS software",
        "Bash shell"
    ],
    "DESCRIPTION": "This script provides a wrapper for running SAS programs within the PBS Pro queueing system. It simplifies the process by providing easy-to-use commands for submitting SAS jobs, setting memory and resource limits, and managing output logs.",
    "FEATURES": [
        "Easy access to PBS Pro features",
        "Automatic resource allocation (memory, sortsize, sumsize)",
        "Support for multiple SAS programs",
        "Customizable options for advanced users",
        "Error handling and logging"
    ],
    "USAGE": [
        "Invoke the script with the appropriate command (e.g., 'qsas' for SAS jobs)",
        "Pass the SAS program file as the first argument",
        "Specify options using double-dash syntax (e.g., --memsize=10000)",
        "The script handles job submission and resource allocation"
    ],
    "NOTES": [
        "The script assumes that the PBS Pro queueing system and SAS software are installed and configured on the system.",
        "The script requires the 'qsub' command to be available in the system's path.",
        "The script can be extended to support other software programs by adding specific handlers and parsing logic."
