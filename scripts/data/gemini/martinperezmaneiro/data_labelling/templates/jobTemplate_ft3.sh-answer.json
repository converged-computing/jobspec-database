    "details": "The script is designed to run on a SLURM cluster, using the SLURM workload manager to submit and manage the job. The script utilizes several SLURM directives to specify job parameters:\n\n* **--job-name**: Specifies a name for the job.\n* **--output**: Specifies the file to which standard output will be redirected.\n* **--error**: Specifies the file to which standard error will be redirected.\n* **--ntasks**: Specifies the total number of tasks to be launched.\n* **--time**: Specifies the maximum runtime for the job.\n* **--cpus-per-task**: Specifies the number of CPUs to be allocated per task.\n* **--mem-per-cpu**: Specifies the amount of memory to be allocated per CPU.\n\nThe script also includes directives for specifying the quality of service (qos) and partition to be used, as well as the number of nodes to be allocated. \n\nThe script then sources two shell scripts: `$STORE/ic_setup.sh` and `$HOME/data_labelling/setup.sh`. These scripts likely contain configurations and environment variables necessary to run the core job tasks. Finally, the script executes the specified tasks and waits for them to complete."
