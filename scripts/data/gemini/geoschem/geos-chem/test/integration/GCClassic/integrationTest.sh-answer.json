    "application": "GEOS-Chem",
    "details": "This script runs integration tests for the GEOS-Chem Global Chemical Transport Model. It includes features for both compilation-only and full execution tests, with support for different testing environments and schedulers. It relies on several external scripts and functions, including:\n\n* `commonFunctionsForTests.sh`: Contains common functions used across tests.\n* `integrationTestCreate.sh`: Creates the necessary run directories for the integration tests.\n* `integrationTestCompile.sh`: Handles compilation of the GEOS-Chem code.\n* `integrationTestExecute.sh`: Handles the execution of GEOS-Chem for the integration tests.\n\nThe script also utilizes various Bash commands and tools for file manipulation, environment variable management, and interaction with the operating system, including:\n\n* `getopt`: Parses command-line arguments.\n* `sed`: Edits files for environment specific configurations.\n* `bsub`: Submits jobs to a LSF (Load Sharing Facility) scheduler.\n* `sbatch`: Submits jobs to a SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) scheduler.\n\nIn addition to the external scripts and functions, the script depends on several environment variables and user-provided inputs, including:\n\n* `itRoot`: Root directory for integration tests.\n* `envFile`: Environment file for specific software configurations.\n* `testsToRun`: Type of tests to run ('compile' or 'all').\n* `quick`: Flag to run a quick set of tests.\n* `bootStrap`: Flag to control the bootstrapping of missing variables in restart files.\n* `site`: Name of the computing environment (e.g., Cannon, Compute1).\n\nThe script utilizes a combination of bash scripting, environment variable handling, and external tool calls to achieve its purpose."
