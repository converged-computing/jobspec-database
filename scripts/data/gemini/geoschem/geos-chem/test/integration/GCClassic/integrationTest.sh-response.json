It includes features for both compilation-only and full execution tests, with support for different testing environments and schedulers. It relies on several external scripts and functions, including:\\n\\n* `commonFunctionsForTests.sh`: Contains common functions used across tests.\\n* `integrationTestCreate.sh`: Creates the necessary run directories for the integration tests.\\n* `integrationTestCompile.sh`: Handles compilation of the GEOS-Chem code.\\n* `integrationTestExecute.sh`: Handles the execution of GEOS-Chem for the integration tests.\\n\\nThe script also utilizes various Bash commands and tools for file manipulation, environment variable management, and interaction with the operating system, including:\\n\\n* `getopt`: Parses command-line arguments.\\n* `sed`: Edits files for environment specific configurations.\\n* `bsub`: Submits jobs to a LSF (Load Sharing Facility) scheduler.\\n* `sbatch`: Submits jobs to a SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) scheduler.\\n\\nIn addition to the external scripts and functions, the script depends on several environment variables and user-provided inputs, including:\\n\\n* `itRoot`: Root directory for integration tests.\\n* `envFile`: Environment file for specific software configurations.\\n* `testsToRun`: Type of tests to run ('compile' or 'all').\\n* `quick`: Flag to run a quick set of tests.\\n* `bootStrap`: Flag to control the bootstrapping of missing variables in restart files.\\n* `site`: Name of the computing environment (e.g., Cannon, Compute1).\\n\\nThe script utilizes a combination of bash scripting, environment variable handling, and external tool calls to achieve its purpose.\"\n}\n```"
