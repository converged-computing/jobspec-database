    "details": "The script runs parallelization tests for the GEOS-Chem Classic global chemical transport model, using the SLURM or LSF schedulers. It checks the performance of the model with different numbers of OpenMP threads.\n\n**Software Requirements:**\n\n* GEOS-Chem Classic (installed in the CodeDir directory)\n* SLURM or LSF scheduler\n* Bash shell\n* Git (for obtaining the commit information)\n* sed (for modifying configuration files)\n*  rename (for renaming restart files)\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n* The script uses a docker image (registry.gsc.wustl.edu/sleong/esm:intel-2021.1.2).\n* It requests 24 cores (using `-c 24`) and 90 GB of memory (`--mem=90000`) for a maximum run time of 6 hours (`-t 0-6:00`).\n* The `-p REQUESTED_PARTITION` flag specifies the desired partition (e.g., a high-memory queue) for the job.\n\n**Other Notable Points:**\n\n* The script uses a series of `SBATCH` or `BSUB` directives to define job parameters for SLURM or LSF.\n* It defines several global variables, including `ptRoot` (the path to the parent directory) and `allThreads` (the number of OpenMP threads).\n* The script uses several shell functions, such as `count_rundirs`, `get_site_name`, `exe_name`, `is_valid_rundir`, and `rename_end_restart_file`. These functions are likely defined in `commonFunctionsForTests.sh`\n* The script includes sanity checks for the environment variables and attempts to handle different execution environments (interactive, SLURM, LSF)."
