It requires a GPU, CPU, memory, network and disk space. The script uses a variety of tools including Bash, GCC, Make, Syslogger and Sys2csv. \n\nThe script utilizes features of the Slurm scheduler to manage the execution environment, including defining the number of nodes, the exclusive use of the node, the job name, and the maximum run time. It also uses CUDA to run the simulation and Nvidia UVM to manage the GPU memory.\n\nThe script sets up the environment with specific modules and kernel drivers and runs a loop over different problem sizes and batch sizes. It then performs a simulation and logs relevant information, including allocation times, performance metrics, and dmesg output.\n\nThe script includes various optimizations, such as prefetching, and utilizes threading with OpenMP. \n\nThis script is designed to run an HPGMG simulation on a high-performance computing cluster with a focus on performance and resource utilization. \n"
