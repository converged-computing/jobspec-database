It makes use of the following software:\n\n* **NAMD:** A molecular dynamics simulation program.\n* **hpcbench:** A toolkit for benchmarking HPC applications.\n* **Slurm:** A workload manager for HPC systems.\n* **CUDA:** A parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-purpose computing on their graphics processing units (GPUs).\n* **GCC:** The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages.\n* **Miniforge3:** A lightweight and cross-platform Python distribution built upon the conda package and environment manager.\n\nThe script also makes use of several system resources, including:\n\n* **GPU:** The script requests one GPU.\n* **CPU:** The script uses all 72 CPUs on the node.\n* **Memory:** The script uses all of the node's memory.\n* **Power Monitoring:** The script monitors the power consumption of the entire system, the Grace Hopper system, the CPUs, and the I/O.\n* **File System:** The script uses a number of files for logging and output. These files are located in the user's home directory.\n\nThe script also includes several environment variables that are used to configure the simulation. These variables include:\n\n* **num_gpus:** The number of GPUs to use for the simulation.\n* **gpus:** A list of GPUs to use for the simulation.\n* **jobname:** The name of the job.\n* **comment:** A comment to be added to the output files.\n\nThe script then runs the NAMD simulation using the specified parameters. After the simulation is complete, the script gathers the output files and stores them in a single output file.\n"
