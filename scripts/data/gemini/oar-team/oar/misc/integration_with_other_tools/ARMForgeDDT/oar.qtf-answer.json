    "details": "This script is designed to be a template for launching applications using the OAR batch scheduler, particularly for use within the Arm Forge environment. It defines parameters for configuring jobs, including wall-clock limits, queue selection, and resource allocation (nodes, processes, threads). The script leverages OAR commands for job submission, status checking, and cancellation. It incorporates placeholders for user-defined application paths, arguments, and MPI settings, facilitating integration with Arm Forge's DDT GUI. Notably, the script enables utilization of whole nodes or specific cores, and provides flexibility for configuring MPI communication methods like Infiniband or Ethernet. Additionally, it includes provisions for installing packages on nodes, enhancing the script's capability for environment setup."
