The script uses the following software:\n\n* **GROMACS 2021.1:** The primary simulation software used to perform the molecular dynamics simulation.\n* **mvapich2 2.2:** A high-performance MPI implementation for parallel computing, enabling efficient communication between processing units during the simulation.\n* **CUDA 9.1.85.3:** A parallel computing platform that enables GROMACS to utilize the GPUs on the cluster for accelerating simulation performance.\n* **GNU 7.3.0:** A collection of free software tools, including compilers and libraries, providing the necessary environment for running the software.\n\nThe script utilizes the following resources:\n\n* **1 node:**  The simulation runs on a single node of the cluster.\n* **1 task:** The script utilizes a single task on the node.\n* **28 CPUs per task:**  28 processor cores are assigned to the task to handle the computational demands of the simulation.\n* **20GB of memory:** The script requests 20GB of RAM for the simulation to operate effectively.\n* **GPU partition:** The script specifies the GPU partition on the cluster, ensuring access to nodes equipped with GPUs for faster simulation speeds.\n* **4 hours of wall time:** The script requests a maximum runtime of 4 hours.\n* **2 Tesla GPUs:**  The script requests access to two Tesla GPUs, further enhancing simulation performance.\n* **Environment variables:** The script sets environment variables, `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and `MV2_ENABLE_AFFINITY`, to fine-tune the performance of the simulation.\n\nThe script is designed to handle checkpoints and resubmission, allowing for long simulations to be run reliably. This is a common practice in molecular dynamics simulations, where the simulation can be restarted from a checkpoint if it needs to be interrupted. The `errexit()` function ensures that the script handles errors gracefully and automatically resubmits the job if necessary.\n\nThe script is set up to use a specific naming convention for the input and output files, making it easy to track and manage the simulation. The script also includes some basic cleanup and logging features. \n"
