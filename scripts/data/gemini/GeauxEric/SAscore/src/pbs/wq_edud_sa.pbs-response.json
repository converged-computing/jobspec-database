This script leverages several tools and resources:\n\n**Software:**\n\n* **wq:** The main framework used to manage the distributed computation. This appears to be a custom framework or a project based on `wq` from https://github.com/wq/wq.\n* **Python:** Used to execute the `wq.py` script which manages the dispatcher and workers.\n* **ssh:** Used to securely connect and execute commands on remote compute nodes.\n* **wc:** Used for counting lines in files, determining the number of tasks.\n* **grep:** Used for searching specific strings in files, filtering hosts.\n* **sort:** Used to sort hosts and ensure the mother superior's host name comes first in the list.\n* **head:** Used to read the first line of the hostlist to identify the mother superior.\n* **gawk:** Used for simple data processing and calculation of the number of nodes.\n* **uname:** Used to obtain the host name of the running machine.\n* **cut:** Used to extract specific parts of a line in the file output.\n* **cp:** Used to copy files, specifically the script itself and the `wq.py` file.\n* **chmod:** Used to change file permissions, making the copied script executable.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **nodes=3:ppn=20:** This specifies the PBS (Portable Batch System) resource request for 3 nodes, each with 20 processors (ppn).\n* **walltime=72:00:00:** This sets the maximum wall clock time for the job to 72 hours.\n* **workq:** The PBS queue where the job is submitted.\n* **edud_as:** The name given to the PBS job.\n* **/work/jaydy/working:** The working directory where all the files, scripts, and output are located.\n* **/home/${USER}/Workspace/Bitbucket/wq/wq.py:** The path to the `wq.py` script which manages the distributed computation.\n* **all_edud_smi_paths.txt:** A file containing paths to the input data for the tasks.\n* **edud.py:** The Python script that contains the actual computational task to be executed.\n* **hostlist:** A file that stores the list of nodes participating in the computation.\n* **pbs:** The PBS system used to manage the execution environment and resources.\n\n**Overall, this script uses `wq` to run a distributed computation on 3 nodes with 20 cores each, with a maximum runtime of 72 hours. It relies on `Python` and other command-line tools to manage the workflow, communication between nodes, and execution of tasks.**"
