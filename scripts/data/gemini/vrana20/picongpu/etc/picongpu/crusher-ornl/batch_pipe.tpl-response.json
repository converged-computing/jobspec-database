It uses SLURM as the batch system for managing resources like nodes, CPUs, and GPUs. It leverages MPI for parallel communication and relies on libraries like openPMD and ADIOS2 for data handling. \n\nThe script includes several features:\n\n* **Resource Management:** It utilizes SLURM directives to specify the job's resource requirements, including the number of nodes, GPUs, CPUs per task, and the network configuration.\n* **GPU Health Check:** It employs `cuda_memtest` to test the health of the GPUs before launching the main simulation.\n* **Environment Setup:** It sources the PIConGPU environment profile and sets environment variables related to MPI, OpenMP, and chunk distribution.\n* **Parallel Execution:** It uses `srun` to launch both PIConGPU and openpmd-pipe, ensuring their parallel execution across multiple nodes.\n* **Data Handling:** It relies on ADIOS2 and its streaming capabilities for data storage and retrieval.\n* **Error Handling:** The script includes error checks and logging mechanisms to capture potential issues and provide relevant messages.\n\nThe script utilizes a comprehensive set of environment variables and SLURM directives to control the execution of PIConGPU and ensure its efficient and reliable operation."
