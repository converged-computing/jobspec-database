    "details": "This script utilizes Snakemake, a workflow management system, for running a pipeline. It requires the Snakemake executable, as well as Singularity to run the pipeline in a containerized environment. The script leverages SLURM, a job scheduler, to manage the submission and execution of the pipeline's jobs on a high-performance computing cluster. It also utilizes a number of bash shell utilities, including `readlink`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `date`, and `sbatch`, along with various other commands for file manipulation and execution control."
