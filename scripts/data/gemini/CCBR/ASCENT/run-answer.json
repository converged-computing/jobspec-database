    "description": "This script is a wrapper for running a Snakemake pipeline. It can either run the pipeline locally on an interactive node or submit it to the SLURM load scheduler. It also includes functions for initializing the work directory, resetting it, dry-running the pipeline, unlocking it if it was previously locked by Snakemake, and generating a DAG of the pipeline."
