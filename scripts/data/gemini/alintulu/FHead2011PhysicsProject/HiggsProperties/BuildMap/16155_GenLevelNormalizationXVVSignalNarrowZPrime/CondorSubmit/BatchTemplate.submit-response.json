This indicates the script is intended to be run as a batch job on an LSF-managed cluster.\n* **Details:**\n    * **queue:** The `BSUB -q 2nw` directive specifies the \"2nw\" queue for the job submission. This suggests the script is requesting resources from a particular queue within the LSF system.\n    * **scram_arch:**  The `SCRAM_ARCH` environment variable is set to `slc6_amd64_gcc491`, indicating the specific software architecture required for the script execution. This likely refers to a scientific software environment, possibly related to high-energy physics or similar fields.\n    * **cmssw_version:** The `cd` command navigates to a directory containing a specific version of CMSSW (CMSSW_7_5_8_patch3). CMSSW stands for \"Common Software for High Energy Physics,\" a widely used software framework in particle physics.\n* **Other components:**\n    * **scramv1 runtime -sh:** This command likely executes a script or command that sets up the CMSSW environment. \n    * **__EXECUTABLE__ 18.4 0 __RUNNUMBER__ > Result.txt:**  This line seems to be placeholder code. It suggests the script is designed to run an executable named \"__EXECUTABLE__\" with some parameters (18.4, 0, __RUNNUMBER__). The output is directed to a file named \"Result.txt\". \n    * **mv Result.txt __RESULT__:** This command moves the \"Result.txt\" file to a location specified by the \"__RESULT__\" variable, indicating the script might be designed to generate output data files.\n\nIn essence, the script sets up a specific software environment (CMSSW) on an LSF cluster, runs an executable, and potentially saves the results to a file. \n"
