This queue likely represents a specific resource configuration within the LSF cluster. \n* **CMSSW:** The script utilizes the CMSSW (CMS Software) framework, a large and complex software suite used for analyzing data from the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The line `export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc491` sets up the specific architecture of the CMSSW environment. The subsequent `eval `scramv1 runtime -sh` command initializes the CMSSW environment.\n* **cmsStage:** The `cmsStage` command is used to download data files from the CMS storage system. It stages the files `HiForest_0.root` and `HiForest_1.root` locally as `Input0.root` and `Input1.root` respectively.\n* **Data Processing:** The script then executes commands like `ls` and `/afs/cern.ch/user/c/chenyi/work/PhysicsWorkspace/HIJetMass/JetStudies/15743_CS/RunCheckPartIV Input0.root Output_HiForest_0.root` which likely represent some data processing or analysis steps. The specific tool or application used in `RunCheckPartIV` is unclear but likely something specific to CMS data analysis.\n* **File Transfer:**  Finally, the script uses `cp` to copy the processed files `Output_HiForest_0.root` and `Output_HiForest_1.root` to a directory within the user's AFS (Andrew File System) space. \n\nIn essence, this script performs a data analysis task using CMSSW within the LSF environment. It downloads data, processes it, and then saves the results. \n"
