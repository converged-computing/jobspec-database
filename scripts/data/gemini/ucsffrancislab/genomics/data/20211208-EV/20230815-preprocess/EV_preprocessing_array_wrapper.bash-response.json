The script utilizes Slurm features like `sbatch` for job submission and environment variables like `SLURM_JOBID`, `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`, `SLURM_NTASKS`, and `SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE`. \n* **Scratch:**  Likely used for temporary storage during the analysis.  The script requests a certain amount of scratch space (`--gres=scratch:${scratch_size}G`) when submitting the job.\n* **Threads:** The script utilizes multiple threads (`--runThreadN ${threads}`) for parallelization to speed up processing.\n* **Memory:** The script requests a specific amount of memory (`--mem=${mem}`) per node for each job.\n\nThe script is designed to be run on a cluster using Slurm. It processes multiple fastq files in an array job, performs quality control, trimming, alignment, duplicate marking, and finally creates a final BAM file with UMI information incorporated into a tag. \n"
