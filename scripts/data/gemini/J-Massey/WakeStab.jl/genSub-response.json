Slurm is a workload manager used for scheduling and managing jobs on high-performance computing systems.\n* **details:** This section provides a detailed breakdown of the resources and software requirements specified in the script:\n    * **nodes:** The number of compute nodes required for the job (2 in this case).\n    * **tasks:** The number of parallel processes or tasks the job will use (128 in this case).\n    * **memory:** The amount of memory requested per node (378240 MB in this case).\n    * **partition:** The specific resource partition or queue where the job should be run (highmem in this case).\n    * **job_name:** A user-defined name for the job (wake-RA in this case).\n    * **time:** The maximum time the job is allowed to run (20 hours in this case).\n    * **output_file:** The name of the file where standard output from the job will be written (RAND-RA.out in this case).\n    * **excluded_nodes:** A list of nodes that should not be used for this job.\n    * **dependency:**  A dependency on a previously submitted job with ID 1908224. This means the current job will only start after the specified job completes successfully.\n    * **modules:** A list of software modules that need to be loaded for the job to run. These modules include:\n        * conda: A package manager for Python.\n        * an: A conda environment that is likely activated for the job.\n        * texlive: A set of tools for typesetting documents.\n    * **script:** The name of the Python script that will be executed by the job (src/DMD-RA-working.py).\n\nThe script also uses the `module` command to load necessary software modules and `source` to activate a conda environment. \n"
