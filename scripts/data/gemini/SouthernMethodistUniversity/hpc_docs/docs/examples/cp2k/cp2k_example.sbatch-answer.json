    "application": "CP2K",
    "details": "This script utilizes the CP2K software package for running quantum chemistry simulations. It leverages the Slurm workload manager for job submission and resource allocation. The script requests 2 nodes with 36 tasks per node, ensuring exclusive access to these resources. It specifies the 'development' partition for job execution and sets up the environment by loading necessary modules, including CP2K via spack. Environment variables are set for MPI communication and CP2K data directory. Finally, the 'srun' command executes the CP2K calculation with the specified input file 'water_pbed3.inp'."
