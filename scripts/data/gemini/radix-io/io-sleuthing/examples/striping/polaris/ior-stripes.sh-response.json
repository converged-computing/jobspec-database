The output files are stored in the user's scratch directory under `/grand/radix-io/scratch/$USER/ior`.\n    * **Network:** The script utilizes Infiniband for communication between compute nodes. This is typical for high-performance computing environments.\n\n**Script Functionality:**\n\n* **Purpose:** The script aims to benchmark the performance of the Lustre file system by using IOR with different striping factors.\n* **Striping:** The script tests IOR performance with various striping factors, ranging from 1 to the number of available Lustre servers (or higher for overstriping).\n* **Output:** The script writes the IOR results to files named `ior-stripe-{stripe_factor}.out` in the scratch directory.\n* **Comparison:** The script also includes a comparison with a file-per-process (FPP) setup, which doesn't use striping. This provides a baseline for comparison.\n* **Performance Analysis:** By analyzing the I/O performance metrics of the IOR output files, users can assess the impact of striping on their application's performance. \n"
