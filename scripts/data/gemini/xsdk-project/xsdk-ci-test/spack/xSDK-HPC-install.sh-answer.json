    "details": "This script utilizes SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) to manage and execute tasks on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. It leverages Spack, a package manager for scientific software, to install the XSDK software. The script iterates through available compilers (identified by their versions, e.g., @gcc-10.3.0) and sets up a directory for each compiler, creating a shell script within it that installs XSDK using Spack with the specified compiler. This script is designed for running on a SLURM-enabled HPC system, requiring access to the SLURM command line interface and Spack environment."
