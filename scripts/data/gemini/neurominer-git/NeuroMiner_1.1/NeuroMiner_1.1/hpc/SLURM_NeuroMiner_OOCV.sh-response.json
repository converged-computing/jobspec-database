The user needs to specify the number of threads for OpenMP. \n* **MATLAB Runtime:** The script relies on the MATLAB Runtime environment to execute the NeuroMiner code. \n* **SLURM:**  The script relies on SLURM for managing and submitting jobs to a cluster. \n\n**Script Functionality:**\n\nThe script manages a set of jobs for NeuroMiner to analyze independent data and optimize model parameters. It does this by:\n\n1. **Setting up the environment:**  It sets environment variables for the NeuroMiner directory, the MATLAB runtime library path, and job directory.\n2. **Collecting input:**  It asks the user for important information, including:\n   *  Path to the NeuroMiner structure\n   *  Path to the job directory \n   *  Email address for notifications \n   *  Indices for the analysis and independent data containers\n   *  Path to optimized models and parameters (if applicable)\n   *  Number of CPUs for each job\n   *  RAM allocation for each job\n   *  Whether to use OpenMP and how many threads\n   *  CV2 grid parameters (start and end rows and columns)\n   *  Number of SGE jobs\n3. **Generating parameter files:** It generates parameter files for each job. These files contain information needed by the NeuroMiner executable.\n4. **Generating SLURM scripts:** It generates SLURM scripts for each job, specifying the resources, environment, and commands to run the NeuroMiner code.\n5. **Submitting jobs:** It submits the jobs to SLURM for execution.\n\nOverall, this script helps automate the process of running NeuroMiner on a cluster system. It provides a user-friendly way to set up the analysis, manage resources, and execute multiple jobs simultaneously.\n"
