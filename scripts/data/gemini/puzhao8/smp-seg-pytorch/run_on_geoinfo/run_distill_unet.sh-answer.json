    "details": "The script utilizes the Slurm workload manager to execute a Python-based deep learning model training job. It defines various Slurm parameters, including:\n\n* **-N 1**: Requests one node for the job.\n* **--gres=gpu:1**: Requests one GPU for the job.\n* **--mem 36GB**: Allocates 36GB of RAM for the job.\n* **--cpus-per-task 8**: Assigns 8 CPUs to each task.\n* **-t 7-00:00:00**: Sets a time limit of 7 days for the job.\n* **--job-name distill-unet**: Names the job \"distill-unet\".\n* **--output /home/p/u/puzhao/run_logs/%x-%A_%a.out**: Directs the job output to a specific directory and file.\n\nThe script then activates a conda environment named \"pytorch\" and executes a Python script (main_s1s2_distill_unet.py) using various command-line arguments. These arguments control different aspects of the training process, including the model architecture, training data, loss function, optimizer, batch size, and more. The script also utilizes the NVIDIA SMI tool to display GPU information."
