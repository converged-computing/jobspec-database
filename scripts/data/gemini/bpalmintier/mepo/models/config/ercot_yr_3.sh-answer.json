        "The script runs a series of GAMS jobs to compare the run time of different unit commitment models.",
        "It uses the CPLEX solver and requires a scratch space directory for temporary files.",
        "The script uses PBS (Portable Batch System) to submit jobs to a cluster.",
        "It loads modules for GAMS and CPLEX using the `module` command.",
        "It sets environment variables for GAMS and CPLEX.",
        "It defines a working directory in the scratch space and copies the GAMS model file to it.",
        "It runs GAMS jobs with specific options and stores the results in a designated output directory.",
        "The script uses a template to repeat the GAMS job execution with different configurations.",
        "The script waits for all jobs to complete and then cleans up the scratch space directory."
