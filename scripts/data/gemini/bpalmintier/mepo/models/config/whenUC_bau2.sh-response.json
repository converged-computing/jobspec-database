It utilizes several other software packages and resources:\n\n* **GAMS:** The General Algebraic Modeling System, a high-level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization.\n* **CPLEX:**  A high-performance mathematical programming solver, used to solve the optimization problems within the GAMS model.\n* **SVN:** A version control system for managing code, used to keep track of revisions to the model.\n* **MATLAB:** A programming and numerical computation environment, potentially used for data analysis and visualization related to the model.\n* **PBS:** Portable Batch System, a queuing system for scheduling jobs on a cluster, used to manage the execution of the GAMS model.\n* **`df`:** A command-line utility for displaying disk space usage information, used for monitoring disk usage.\n* **`cat`:** A command-line utility for displaying the contents of files, used to display the node list from PBS.\n* **`mkdir`:** A command-line utility for creating directories, used for creating temporary and output directories.\n* **`rm`:** A command-line utility for removing files and directories, used for cleaning up temporary files and directories.\n* **`cp`:** A command-line utility for copying files, used for copying the GAMS model file to temporary directories.\n* **`pwd`:** A command-line utility for displaying the current working directory, used for tracking the execution environment.\n* **`date`:** A command-line utility for displaying the current date and time, used for recording the execution time of the model.\n* **`echo`:** A command-line utility for displaying text, used for printing messages to the terminal.\n* **`wait`:** A command-line utility for waiting until all background processes finish, used to ensure the GAMS model completes before proceeding with other operations.\n\nThe script utilizes several computational resources:\n\n* **Nodes:** The script requests one node with 12 processors.\n* **Memory:** The script requests 40GB of memory.\n* **Scratch Space:** The script uses scratch space to store temporary files, allowing for efficient file operations.\n* **Disk Space:** The script uses disk space to store the GAMS model, input files, output files, and log files.\n* **CPU time:**  The script utilizes CPU time for executing the GAMS model and other command-line utilities.\n\nThe script also uses a queue called \"xlong\" that allows for extended run times of up to 168 hours. This suggests that the GAMS model may take a significant amount of time to complete. \n"
