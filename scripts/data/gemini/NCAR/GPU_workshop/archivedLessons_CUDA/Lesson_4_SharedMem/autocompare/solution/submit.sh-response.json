This is likely used for CUDA programming and optimizing code for NVIDIA GPUs.\n* **resources:** The script requests several resources:\n    * **GPU: v100:** One NVIDIA V100 GPU is requested for the job.\n    * **1 node:** The job needs one compute node to run.\n    * **1 task per node:** Only one task is allocated per node.\n    * **dav partition:** The job is submitted to a partition named \"dav\" on the cluster. \n    * **casper_8xV100 reservation:** The job uses a reservation called \"casper_8xV100\". This implies the reservation likely provides access to 8 V100 GPUs.\n    * **15 minutes runtime:** The job is allocated a maximum of 15 minutes to execute.\n    * **log.matmul_%j.out output file:** The output of the job is directed to a file named \"log.matmul_%j.out\" (where `%j` is replaced by the job ID).\n    * **GPU_matmul job name:** The job is given the name \"GPU_matmul\".\n\nThe script also sets up some environment variables related to CUDA libraries and defines the comparison mode for the `matmul.exe` executable. \n"
