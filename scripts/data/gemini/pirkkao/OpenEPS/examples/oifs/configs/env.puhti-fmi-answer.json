        "CPU": "The script uses a variable \"CPUSTOT\" to calculate the total number of cores used based on the number of nodes and cores per node. This suggests it's running on a cluster environment like a supercomputer, which often uses a resource manager like Slurm.",
        "Memory": "The script sets a memory limit per CPU using \"#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4000\". This implies a need for a considerable amount of memory for each core.",
        "Storage": "The script accesses various directories on the system, including those related to input data, output data, and model executables. This shows that the script relies on a robust storage system.",
        "Network": "The script requires a network connection for communication between nodes in the cluster, which is a common requirement for distributed applications."
