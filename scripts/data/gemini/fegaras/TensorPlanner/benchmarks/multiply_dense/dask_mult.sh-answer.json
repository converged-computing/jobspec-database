        "SLURM": "The script uses SLURM for job submission and resource allocation. It defines job name, output file, and uses SLURM environment variables like SLURM_NNODES and SLURM_NTASKS.",
        "OpenMPI": "The script loads OpenMPI modules for parallel execution of the Python script using MPI.",
        "virtual environment": "The script activates a Python virtual environment using 'source $PYTHON_ENV/bin/activate' for managing Python dependencies.",
        "Dask": "The script runs a Python script named 'Multiply_Dask.py' which likely uses Dask for distributed matrix multiplication.  It takes three arguments: n, m, and iterations which are likely dimensions of the matrices and number of iterations."
