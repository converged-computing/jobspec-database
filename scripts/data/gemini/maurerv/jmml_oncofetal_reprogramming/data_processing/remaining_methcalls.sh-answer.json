    "description": "This script uses MethylDackel to extract methylation calls from BAM files. It uses bsub to submit jobs to a cluster and utilizes conda to manage dependencies. It also uses awk and sed for file processing. The script requires a reference genome file (hs37d5_PhiX_Lambda.fa) and a list of BAM files as input."
