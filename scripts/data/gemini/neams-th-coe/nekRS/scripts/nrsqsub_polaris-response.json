The script is designed to run on the **Polaris** supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, utilizing its **CUDA** GPUs and **MPI** for parallel processing.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script and its resource requirements:\n\n**Software:**\n\n* **NekRS:** This is a specific version of Nek5000 designed for running on parallel architectures, especially with GPUs.\n* **MPI (Message Passing Interface):** MPI is used for parallel communication between nodes on the cluster.\n* **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):** CUDA is the programming model and runtime environment for NVIDIA GPUs, allowing for massive parallel computation.\n* **Libfabric:** A high-performance communication library used for networking and MPI communication.\n* **PrgEnv-gnu:** A software environment that provides tools and libraries for compiling and running programs.\n* **Nvhpc-mixed:** A compiler designed to work with NVIDIA GPUs and Intel CPUs.\n* **CMake:** A cross-platform build system used for automating the building of software projects.\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n* **Queue:**  The script specifies a \"prod\" queue, meaning it is intended for production runs. \n* **Walltime:**  The script takes a time parameter in the format `hh:mm:ss` representing the maximum allowed runtime for the job.\n* **Nodes:** The script requires a specific number of compute nodes, which are defined as the parameter `nodes`.\n* **System:** The script targets the `polaris` system, a supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory.\n* **GPU per Node:**  The script requests 4 GPUs per node.\n* **Cores per NUMA:**  The script uses 8 cores per NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node. \n* **Filesystems:** The script specifies access to the `home`, `eagle`, and `grand` filesystems.\n* **Place:**  The script uses `place=scatter`, indicating the nodes should be scattered across the cluster for better performance.\n\nThe script uses environment variables to configure the NekRS software and its parallel execution environment. It also sets specific parameters for MPI and CUDA to optimize for the target hardware. The `sbatch` command is used to submit the job to the batch system, which handles resource allocation and scheduling.\n\nThis breakdown provides a detailed explanation of the application and its resource requirements. It highlights the importance of understanding the specific software and hardware needs of a job when running it on a supercomputer like Polaris. \n"
