        "The script uses COBALT for job submission and resource allocation.",
        "It requests a 2-hour time limit, 1 node, and the 'bigmem' queue.",
        "It specifies the 'datascience' account and sets the output file to 'xbg_within_task_transfer_bert'.",
        "It requires access to multiple filesystems: 'home', 'theta-fs0', 'grand', and 'eagle'.",
        "The script uses the 'conda/pytorch' module and activates the 'tvm_build' environment.",
        "It sets the 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES' environment variable to '1' indicating GPU usage.",
        "It uses the 'TVM_HOME' environment variable to point to the directory containing TVM's python library.",
        "The 'PYTHONPATH' environment variable is updated to include the TVM library directory.",
        "The script runs the 'tune_network.py' script with different batch sizes (1, 2, 4, 8) for tuning the 'bert_tiny' network using a XGBoost cost model and transfer learning.",
        "The cost model is loaded from the specified location and the script runs the tuning on a CUDA target.",
        "The script records the start and end time of the execution."
