The script also accesses several file systems.\n* **Software Environment:** The script uses a conda environment named \"tvm_build\", which likely includes pre-built versions of TVM, Python, and other necessary libraries. It also loads a specific version of llvm for compilation.\n* **Tuning with Transfer Learning:** The script performs tuning experiments for the \"inception_v3\" neural network using an XGBoost-based cost model. The tuning process aims to find the optimal configuration for different batch sizes, both with and without transfer tuning.\n* **Data and Models:** The script relies on several files stored on the \"gpfs/jlse-fs0\" file system for model loading and other data.\n* **Performance Monitoring:** The script uses \"time\" to measure the execution time of each tuning experiment.\n\n**In summary, this script performs automated neural network tuning for the Inception v3 model using TVM on an A40 GPU, utilizing pre-trained cost models and transfer learning techniques to optimize the performance of the network.** \n"
