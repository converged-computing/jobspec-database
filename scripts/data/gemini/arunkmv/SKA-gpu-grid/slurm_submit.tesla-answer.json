    "application": "GPUGrid",
    "details": "The script runs the GPUGrid application on a SLURM cluster, specifically on the Wilkes cluster at the University of Edinburgh. It utilizes Intel MPI and possibly OpenMP, with specific settings for pin domain and order. It also uses the 'module' command to load specific environments and sets up the application with configurations like clock boost and work directory. The script allows users to choose the execution command based on the application's type (MPI, OpenMP or hybrid) and provides options to manage tasks per node, environment setup, node allocation, and command execution."
