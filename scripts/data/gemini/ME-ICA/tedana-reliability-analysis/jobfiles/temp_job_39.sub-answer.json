    "details": "The script is designed to run on the LSF (Load Sharing Facility) workload management system. It utilizes several LSF directives to specify job parameters, such as the number of cores (-n 4), resource requirements (-R \"span[ptile=4]\"), job name (-J tedana_39), error file (-eo), output file (-oo), and queue name (-q PQ_nbc). The script also sets up environmental variables, including NPROCS (number of hosts) and OMP_NUM_THREADS (number of threads), and sources a specific Python 3 environment using the command 'source /home/data/nbc/data-analysis/py3_environment'. Finally, it executes a Python script named 'run_reliability_workflows.py' with the argument '39'."
