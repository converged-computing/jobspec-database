    "application": "SLURM",
    "details": "The script uses SLURM to submit a batch job to a cluster. The job runs on a single GPU node with 1 CPU core and 4GB of memory per core. The job name is 'mfch', and the output is logged to a file named 'mfcht%j.log'. The job is submitted as an array with 5 tasks, each running independently. The script uses Python, PyTorch, and a custom environment variable 'mjpro200-py.env'. It also uses the 'top' command to monitor CPU usage. The script includes several commands for different environments: Ant, Swimmer, Hopper, HalfCheetah, Walker, and Pendulum. Each environment command uses different parameters for the 'parser.py' script, which is responsible for training a model. The parameters control various aspects of the training process, including the model type, size, learning rate, number of iterations, and the environment used for training."
