Thus, Python is the primary application.\n* **Software:** The script utilizes several software packages, including:\n    * **gcc/9.1.0:**  A compiler for C/C++ code.\n    * **conda:** A package and environment manager, used to activate the 'sdecouplings' environment.\n    * **NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib:**  These are standard scientific computing libraries in Python. While not explicitly stated in the script, they are highly likely to be used within 'faces.py' based on its name.\n* **Resources:** The script requests resources from the PBS system:\n    * **walltime:** Maximum execution time (30 minutes)\n    * **cpus:** 1 CPU core\n    * **gpus:** 1 GPU\n    * **memory:** 4 GB of RAM\n* **Libraries:** The script uses a conda environment called 'sdecouplings'. This environment likely contains specific libraries needed for the script's functionality.\n* **Other requirements:**\n    * **PBS:** The script relies on the Portable Batch System (PBS) for resource allocation and job management.\n    * **NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib:** These libraries are likely needed by the 'faces.py' script, although they aren't explicitly loaded in the script itself.\n    * **conda environment:** The script requires a working conda environment named 'sdecouplings'.\n\n**Note:**  Without access to the 'faces.py' script, we can't definitively list all of its dependencies. However, the provided information gives a good general idea of the software and resources required for this script.\n"
