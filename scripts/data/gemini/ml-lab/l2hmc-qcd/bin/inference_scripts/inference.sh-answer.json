    "application": "COBALT",
    "details": "The script uses the COBALT job scheduler for allocating resources on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. It sets up various environment variables related to CUDA, TensorFlow, and other libraries to optimize the performance of the job. The script runs a Python program called 'inference.py' using 'mpirun' for parallel execution. The program utilizes TensorFlow and likely involves deep learning or machine learning for inference tasks.\n\nHere are the specific software and resource requirements:\n\n* **COBALT:**  Job scheduler for running the script on an HPC cluster.\n* **Python:**  Programming language used to run 'inference.py'.\n* **TensorFlow:**  Machine learning library for inference operations.\n* **CUDA:**  Parallel computing platform for GPUs.\n* **NCCL:**  Network communication library for GPU-to-GPU communication.\n* **OpenMPI:**  Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for parallel processing.\n* **GPU Resources:**  The script requires GPUs for efficient training and inference.\n* **Conda:**  Environment management system for installing and managing software packages and dependencies."
