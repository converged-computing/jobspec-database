    "details": "This script is a wrapper for submitting fitter jobs to a scheduler, specifically HTCondor, Slurm, SGE or PBS. It defines the configuration of the fitter, such as the root folder, sample type, mass hierarchy, and other options, then generates and submits jobs to the scheduler.\n\nThe script uses existing card templates from the \"cards\" folder and modifies them based on the provided options. It handles both systematic and statistical fits, as well as fast fits for dCP scans.\n\nThe script also includes logic to wait for jobs to finish before moving on to the next point. It supports different scheduler implementations and handles job queuing and running status appropriately."
