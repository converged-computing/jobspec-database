    "details": "The script utilizes the COBALT workload manager to submit a job that uses the aprun command. This job will run the executable `./collectives` on 48 nodes with a runtime of 1 hour. It allocates 8MB huge pages for the job using the `craype-hugepages8M` module. The job is submitted to the `cache-quad` queue with a specific topology requested (`topo48huge`). The script also demonstrates running the executable with varying numbers of ranks (1, 4, 16, 64) by modifying the `rpn` variable, which is the number of processes per node."
