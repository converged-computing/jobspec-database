    "details": "This script is a wrapper for submitting a Snakemake pipeline to a job scheduler (currently supports SLURM and UGE). It defines a master job that controls the execution of the pipeline and submits subsequent jobs to the cluster. The script requires the following arguments:\n\n* **MODE:** The Snakemake execution mode (slurm or uge)\n* **-o, --outdir:** Path to the output directory of the pipeline\n* **-j, --job-name:** Name of the master job\n* **-b, --bind-paths:** Singularity bind paths for mounting the host filesystem to the container\n* **-t, --tmp-dir:** Temporary directory for intermediate output files\n\nThe script also supports optional arguments like **-c, --cache** for specifying the singularity cache directory. It performs the following actions:\n\n1. **Parses command-line arguments** using a function named `parser()`. \n2. **Checks for required arguments** using `check()`. \n3. **Ensures dependencies are present** (singularity and snakemake) using `require()`. \n4. **Submits jobs to the chosen scheduler** (slurm or uge) using `submit()`. \n5. **Creates a singularity cache** in the output directory. \n6. **Generates a summary report** after the pipeline completes. \n\nThe script is designed to be used by the main entry point of the pipeline, but it can also be invoked manually. However, it is strongly recommended to use the main entry point as it handles bind paths and other internal configurations."
