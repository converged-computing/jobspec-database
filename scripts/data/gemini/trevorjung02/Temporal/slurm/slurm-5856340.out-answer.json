        "SLURM": "SLURM is a workload manager that is used to submit, run, and manage jobs on a cluster. The script uses SLURM to allocate resources such as GPUs, CPUs, and memory to the job.",
        "conda": "Conda is a package and environment management system that is used to install and manage Python packages and their dependencies. The script uses conda to activate the 'ckl' environment, which contains the necessary packages for running the job.",
        "python": "Python is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. The script uses Python to run the 'run.py' script, which is the main program for the job.",
        "pytorch_lightning": "PyTorch Lightning is a framework that simplifies the process of training deep learning models in PyTorch. The script uses PyTorch Lightning to train a model on a dataset.",
        "wandb": "Weights & Biases (W&B) is a tool that is used to track experiments, visualize results, and share models. The script uses W&B to log the training process and the results of the job.",
        "gpu": "The job requires one GPU from the 'gpu-a40' partition. The script uses the GPU to accelerate the training process.",
        "cpu": "The job requires 8 CPUs per task. The script uses the CPUs to perform computations that are not accelerated by the GPU.",
        "memory": "The job requires 32 GB of memory. The script uses the memory to store the data, the model, and other variables."
