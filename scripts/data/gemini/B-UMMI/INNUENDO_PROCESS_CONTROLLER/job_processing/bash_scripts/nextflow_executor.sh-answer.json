    "application": "Nextflow",
    "details": "This script runs a Nextflow workflow. It uses the 'nextflow' partition on the SLURM cluster, allocating 1500MB of memory per CPU core. It requires the user to provide several parameters, including the path to the job directory, the location of the workflow, the input files, the Nextflow profile, the sample name, and the Nextflow partition. The script creates a 'data' directory within the job directory and links the input files to the directory. It also configures the Nextflow run by including the 'platform.config' file and running the workflow with the specified profile. The output of the Nextflow run is redirected to a 'nextflow_log.txt' file."
