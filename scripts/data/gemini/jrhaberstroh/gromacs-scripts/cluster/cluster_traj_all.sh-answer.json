    "other_details": "The script requires the Gromacs molecular dynamics simulation package, the PBS (Portable Batch System) queuing system, and the FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) library. The script supports execution on the Hopper and Catamount computing clusters. It uses the `qsub` command to submit jobs to the queue and `module load` to load the necessary software modules. The script also specifies core resource requirements for both clusters and uses environment variables to store and access job information. It also uses Bash commands to create and manipulate directories and files."
