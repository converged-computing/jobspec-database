This likely deals with word2vec model training, which is a common application for GPUs.\n    * **Nvidia-smi:** This is a command-line tool for managing and monitoring NVIDIA GPUs. It's used to collect performance metrics.\n* **Resources:**  The script requests several resources from the cluster:\n    * **Cores:** 16 CPU cores are allocated to the job.\n    * **Nodes:** The job runs on a single node.\n    * **GPUs:** 2 GPUs are requested.\n    * **Runtime:** The job is allowed to run for a maximum of 40 hours.\n    * **Memory:** The script doesn't explicitly specify a memory requirement. However, it's likely that SLURM manages memory allocation based on the node's configuration and the total resources requested. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* The script utilizes the `srun` command, which is part of SLURM, to execute the Python program on the allocated resources.\n* The `nvidia-smi` command is used to collect GPU performance data after the training completes. \n* The script assumes that the `w2v3_gpu.py` Python script and the `wd_dir` directory are accessible to the job environment. \n"
