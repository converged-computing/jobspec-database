These packages are:\n\n* `rhel8/default-amp`\n* `cuda/11.8`\n* `miniconda/3`\n\nThe script also sets up a `conda` environment called `L65` and specifies a Python application called `main.py` that uses the `wandb` library for logging experiments.\n\nThe script configures the following environment variables:\n\n* `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to control the number of OpenMP threads.\n* `NODEFILE` to specify the list of nodes allocated for the job.\n* `JOBID` to store the SLURM job ID."
