    "notes": "The script uses Nextflow to run a fine-mapping pipeline. It utilizes the 'finemapping.onlylocus' software, a database for locuszoom plotting, PLINK for reference data, and singularity for containerized execution. The script leverages SLURM for job scheduling and resource management. The environment appears to be a Linux system."
