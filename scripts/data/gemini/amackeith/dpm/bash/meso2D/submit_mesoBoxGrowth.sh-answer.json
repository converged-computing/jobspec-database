    "details": "The script uses the SLURM workload manager to submit a job that runs a MATLAB script. It requires a MATLAB/2021a module to be loaded and relies on a task file ('tasks/mesoBoxGrowth.task') to define the individual tasks to be executed. The script also creates output directories and files for the slurm job and the MATLAB output."
