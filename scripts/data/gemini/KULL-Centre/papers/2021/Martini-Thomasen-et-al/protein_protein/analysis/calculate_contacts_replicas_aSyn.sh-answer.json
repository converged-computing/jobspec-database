The script uses PBS (Portable Batch System) for job submission and resource allocation.",
        "workflow": "The script iterates over ten simulation directories (two_aSyn_1 to two_aSyn_10) and then over three lambda values (1.00, 1.10, 1.12) within each directory. For each lambda value, it generates an index file (aSyn1_aSyn2_lambda*.ndx) to define groups for the two aSyn proteins and calculates the minimum distance between them using gmx mindist. The output files are stored in a data directory within each lambda directory.",
