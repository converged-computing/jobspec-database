The script utilizes various Bash commands and system tools to perform the following:\n\n- **Job Submission and Execution**: The script starts with `#SBATCH` directives, indicating that it is intended to be run under a Slurm workload manager. It defines resources (CPU, memory, runtime) required for the task and sets up logging and error handling.\n- **Task Execution**: The main function (`nxf_main`) handles the actual execution of the task:\n  - It stages input files (`nxf_stage`)\n  - Launches a command (`.command.run`) using Bash in a separate process, capturing output and error streams\n  - Unstages output files (`nxf_unstage`)\n- **Resource Monitoring**:  The script includes functions to monitor the task's CPU usage, memory consumption, and I/O statistics. This data is then written to a trace file (`.command.trace`).\n- **Environment Management**: The script prints environment variables for debugging purposes.\n\nThe script relies on a `.command.sh` file, which is assumed to contain the actual command that the task should execute. This script likely runs within a Nextflow pipeline that orchestrates the overall workflow, including input/output data management. \n"
