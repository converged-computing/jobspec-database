        "This script is a Nextflow task script. It defines a set of functions that are executed by the Nextflow workflow engine. The script is designed to run a command, capture its output and error streams, and track resource usage.",
        "The script uses several environment variables to customize its behavior. The most important of these are NXF_DEBUG, which controls the level of debug output, and NXF_ENTRY, which specifies the function to be executed.",
        "The script also uses several helper functions to perform tasks such as: tracing resource usage, creating temporary directories, staging input files, and unstaging output files."
