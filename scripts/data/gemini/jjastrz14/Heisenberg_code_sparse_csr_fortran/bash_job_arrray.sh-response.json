It utilizes several software modules for compiling and running the Fortran code, including GCCcore, Intel compilers, and FEAST. The script also requests specific computational resources like time, nodes, tasks, and memory. \n\nThe script defines several environment variables using `#SBATCH` directives, which control the execution of the job on the SLURM cluster.  It also uses modules to load specific software packages, including compilers, libraries, and tools needed for the code execution. The script compiles a Fortran program using `ifort` and runs the executable.  It copies the resulting output files to specific locations on the system, demonstrating the use of network file systems like Lustre. \n\nThe script showcases the use of SLURM features like array jobs, which allow running the same job with multiple input parameters in parallel. It also highlights the use of environment variables to access job-specific information like the job ID and the number of CPUs assigned to the job. \n"
