    "application": "Slurm",
    "details": "The script uses the Slurm workload manager to submit and manage jobs. It requests 1 task, a GPU, and allocates 4 hours of runtime. The job runs on the secondary-eth partition and sends email notifications to dmanningcoe@gmail.com. It loads the Anaconda environment (version 2023-Mar/3) and the CUDA toolkit (version 11.7). The script then activates the 'pytorch_one' Conda environment and runs the Python script 'Ising_seed.py', passing the array task ID as an argument. The script uses the 'nvcc' compiler and the 'nvidia-smi' command to check the GPU status."
