    "details": "The script uses the OAR batch scheduler to run experiments.  It's likely that the user is submitting Python scripts to run on a cluster using a conda environment called 'main'. The 'run.py' script performs some type of coreference resolution task, using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The script is configured with various parameters, such as the dataset, task, encoder model, epochs, and learning rate. Some runs utilize the 'wandb' library for experiment tracking."
