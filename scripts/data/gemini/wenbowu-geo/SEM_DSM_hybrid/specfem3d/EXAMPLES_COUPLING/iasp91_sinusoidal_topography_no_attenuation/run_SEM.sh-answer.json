    "script_description": "This script runs the SPECFEM3D seismic simulation software. It first sets up the directory structure and cleans any previous output files. Then, it generates the topography files for the free surface, upper crust interface, and Moho. The script then uses xmeshfem3D to generate the mesh for the simulation and xgenerate_databases to create the databases needed for the simulation. Finally, the script runs xspecfem3D to perform the simulation itself.  The script also includes instructions on how to run the script using a batch system, such as slurm or PBS."
