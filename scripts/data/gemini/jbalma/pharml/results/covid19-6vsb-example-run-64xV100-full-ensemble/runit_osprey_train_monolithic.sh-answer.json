    "other": "The script uses SLURM job scheduler to run a distributed training and inference workflow with Horovod on Cray XC50 with V100 GPUs. It uses a Python script named 'mldock_gnn.py' for training and inference. The script utilizes CUDA for GPU acceleration and MPI for communication between processes. The script uses a number of environment variables, including SCRATCH, CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, and HOROVOD related variables to configure the environment and optimize the performance of the code."
