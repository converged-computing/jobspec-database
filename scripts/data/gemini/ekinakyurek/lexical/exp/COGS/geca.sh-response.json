The script utilizes a single node with a Xeon-G6 processor and a Volta GPU. The job runs for 48 hours and uses 5 CPUs per task, with one task per node. The script also uses the \"high\" quality of service (QoS) and runs 10 separate tasks in an array.\n\nThe script executes a Python script named \"main.py,\" located in the parent directory, using the \"python -u\" command to disable buffering of standard output and standard error streams. The script is configured with several parameters:\n\n- `seed`: A random seed for the experiment, iterating from 0 to 9 for each task.\n- `n_batch`: Batch size for training, set to 128.\n- `n_layers`: Number of layers in the LSTM model, set to 2.\n- `dim`: Dimension of the hidden state in the LSTM model, set to 512.\n- `lr`: Learning rate, set to 1.0.\n- `temp`: Temperature for sampling, set to 1.0.\n- `dropout`: Dropout rate, set to 0.4.\n- `beam_size`: Beam size for decoding, set to 5.\n- `gclip`: Gradient clipping value, set to 5.0.\n- `accum_count`: Gradient accumulation count, set to 4.\n- `valid_steps`: Frequency of validation, set to 500 steps.\n- `warmup_steps`: Number of warmup steps for learning rate, set to 4000.\n- `max_step`: Maximum number of training steps, set to 8000.\n- `tolarance`: Tolerance for early stopping, set to 10.\n- `paug`: Probability of data augmentation, set to 0.1.\n- `tb_dir`: Directory for TensorBoard logs, set to the experiment name.\n- `aug_file`: Path to the data augmentation file, set to \"../geca_j/composed.0.json\".\n- `COGS`: Flag for enabling COGS (Code-Guided Optimization for Generation) training, set to true.\n\nThe script also outputs the results to \"eval.$i.out\" and \"eval.$i.err\" files for each task.\n\nThis script likely utilizes a library called \"geca\" (GitHub repository: https://github.com/jacobandreas/geca), which is essential for the code generation tasks. \n"
