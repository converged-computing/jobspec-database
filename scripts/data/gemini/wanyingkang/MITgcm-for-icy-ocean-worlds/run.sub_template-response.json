If you're using a different batch scheduler, you'll need to adjust the directives accordingly.\n* **Input/Output:** The script manages input and output files, including checkpoints and data files, in a structured way. \n* **Post-Processing:** It performs post-processing steps, including renaming and moving files to a separate directory.\n* **Iteration Management:** The script handles multiple iterations of the MITgcm simulation and submits new jobs as needed.\n* **Error Handling:** Basic checks are implemented to determine if the run was successful and to exit gracefully if issues arise. \n"
