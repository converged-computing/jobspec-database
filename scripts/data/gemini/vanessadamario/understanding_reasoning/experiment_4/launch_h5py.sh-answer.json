        "script_functionality": "The script uses SLURM to allocate resources, define the job name, and set the number of tasks to run. Singularity is used to create a containerized environment with TensorFlow and other necessary dependencies. The script then runs the `main.py` script multiple times, each with different settings for validation and testing. The `--experiment_index` flag appears to control which set of parameters is used for each run. The script also defines a host filesystem and a path for saving output data."
