This indicates that the script likely performs computations using a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n* **Cmake:** The script uses CMake for building the executable file.\n* **OpenMP:** The script utilizes OpenMP for parallel execution on multiple CPU cores, and the number of OpenMP threads is set to 32. \n* **bench_base:** This is the name of the executable file, which is likely a benchmarking tool used for evaluating the performance of different computational tasks.\n* **betacdf:** This seems to be a specific function or algorithm being benchmarked, possibly related to the beta cumulative distribution function.\n\nThe script itself is designed to perform a benchmarking process. It runs the \"bench_base\" executable with different combinations of parameters. The parameters include:\n* `num_elements`: This likely represents the size of the data being processed.\n* `backend`: This parameter determines which execution backend is used, allowing the script to compare CUDA, OpenMP, or a combination of both for execution.\n* `function`:  This indicates the function being tested, which appears to be \"betacdf\".\n* `n`: The script iterates through a range of values for \"n\", likely representing different test scenarios or variations within the benchmarking process.\n\nThe script uses OpenMP to utilize all 32 available cores, suggesting a focus on multi-core performance and scaling. It leverages the A100 GPU for potential acceleration and compares different execution backends for optimal performance. \n"
