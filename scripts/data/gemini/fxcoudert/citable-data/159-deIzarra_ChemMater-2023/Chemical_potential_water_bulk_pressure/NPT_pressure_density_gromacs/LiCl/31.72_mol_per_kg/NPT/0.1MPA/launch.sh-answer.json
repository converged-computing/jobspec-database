    "details": "This script uses SLURM to submit a Gromacs simulation job. It requests 1 node, 4 MPI tasks per node, and 8 OpenMP threads per task. It disables hyperthreading and uses the 'drd' account. It loads specific modules for the GCC compiler, CUDA, OpenMPI, and Gromacs. It runs two simulations: one using the 'eql2.mdp' input file and another using the 'prd.mdp' file. Both simulations utilize the 'gmx_mpi' command with OpenMP parallelization, leveraging the SLURM environment variables for thread count."
