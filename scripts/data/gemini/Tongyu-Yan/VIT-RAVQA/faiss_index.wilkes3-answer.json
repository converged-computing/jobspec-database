    "details": "This script is designed to run a Python application on a SLURM cluster, specifically on Wilkes3 with AMD EPYC 7763 processors, ConnectX-6 network, and A100 GPUs. It uses the `sbatch` command to submit the job, specifying various parameters like job name, project, number of nodes, tasks, GPUs, wallclock time, and email options. It also sets up the environment using `module` commands and activates a conda environment. The script then defines the application path, arguments, and work directory. It allows for using OpenMP for parallel processing. Finally, it executes the application using the defined command, logging the execution details."
