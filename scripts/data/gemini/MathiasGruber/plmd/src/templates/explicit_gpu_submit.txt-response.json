This is indicated by the `module load cuda/5.5` command and the setting of the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable.\n* **Amber:** The script uses the `pmemd.cuda` executable from the Amber package for the actual molecular dynamics simulations.\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n* **CPU:** The script likely requires a significant number of CPU cores for the molecular dynamics calculations.\n* **GPU:** The script specifically mentions CUDA and uses the `pmemd.cuda` executable, indicating that a GPU with CUDA support is necessary.\n* **Walltime:** The `#PBS -l walltime=[WALLCLOCK]` directive specifies the amount of wallclock time requested for the job, suggesting that the simulation could take a significant amount of time to complete.\n* **Memory:** The script does not explicitly specify memory requirements, but molecular dynamics simulations are known to be memory-intensive, requiring considerable RAM.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The script sets up an environment for running Amber by loading the necessary CUDA module, setting the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable, and configuring the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to utilize the GPU assigned by the PBS system.\n* The script defines a function `runMD` to perform individual MD simulations and uses it in a loop to execute the simulation steps.\n* The script outputs logs and restart files to keep track of the simulation progress and results.\n* The script uses a placeholder `[FOLDER]` to represent the directory where the input, output, and intermediate files are stored.\n* The script uses placeholder `[NAME]`, `[CPUCONTROL]`, `[WALLCLOCK]`, `[MDRUNS]`, `[LOGFILENAME]`, and `[AMBERHOME]` to represent variables that should be set before running the script.\n"
