It leverages Slurm's array job feature to launch 16 tasks, each assigned to a different CPU core. The script ensures that the first task (SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID 1) runs the 'leap' command with user-specified arguments, the last task (SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID 16) runs 'runamber' with the '-L' flag, and all other tasks run 'runamber' with no additional arguments.",
            "workflow": "The script uses an if-else structure to handle different tasks based on their SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID. It uses 'runamber' as a command to execute Amber simulations with potentially different flags and arguments."
