It leverages Open MPI for parallel execution. The script provides detailed instructions and options for configuring the job, including resource allocation, environment setup, and job termination handling. The script also includes a section for pre-processing and post-processing tasks.  The user should edit the script to set the job options, provide the name of the MPI program to be executed, and define any necessary pre- or post-processing steps. It utilizes Slurm for job submission and resource allocation, along with Open MPI for parallel execution. The script can be modified to configure the number of nodes, tasks, and CPU cores, and to adjust memory limits, runtime, and other job parameters.  It leverages a variety of environment variables and options for customizing the job setup and execution environment.\"\n}\n```"
