        "notes": "The script uses GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations and allows for different run modes: serial, SLURM, and trun. It utilizes both CPU and GPU resources and requires MPI and OpenMP for parallel execution. The script can be run on a single machine or a cluster using SLURM. The trun command is used to run a job on a multi-core processor with a specific number of processors per node."
