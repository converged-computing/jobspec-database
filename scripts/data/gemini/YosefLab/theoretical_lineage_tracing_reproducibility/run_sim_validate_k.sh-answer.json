    "script_description": "This script is designed to run simulations validating empirical ks on a TORQUE system. It leverages a Python script 'validate_k.py' to perform the simulations and relies on a file containing pre-calculated ks values. The script iterates through various combinations of lambda, q, topologies, algorithms, and metrics, generating output files in a 'results/validate_k' folder."
