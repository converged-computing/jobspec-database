However, it's likely that each node has sufficient GPU memory to accommodate the training process.\n    * **Storage:** The script utilizes GPFS (General Parallel File System) for storing data, checkpoints, and logs. The capacity is not mentioned.\n    * **Network:** The script uses InfiniBand for high-speed communication between nodes. The specific bandwidth is not provided.\n    * **Other:**\n        * **Reservation:** \"hug\" is a reservation on the cluster, suggesting dedicated resources for the job.\n        * **QoS:** \"qos_gpu-gc\" implies a specific Quality of Service level for GPU-intensive tasks.\n        * **Account:** The job is running under the \"six@a100\" account.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* The script is using a combination of model parallelism techniques, including tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP), to distribute the training workload across multiple GPUs and nodes.\n* It utilizes a \"kill-switch\" mechanism to gracefully terminate the training process if needed.\n* It utilizes several environment variables to configure the training environment, including those related to the cache for models, datasets, and other Hugging Face components.\n* The script is configured to use bf16 (Brain Floating Point 16) precision for training, which is a more efficient representation of floating-point numbers for deep learning.\n* It uses DeepSpeed's Zero Stage 0 optimization for memory efficiency.\n* The script utilizes TensorBoard for logging and visualization of training metrics.\n"
