It utilizes the SLURM batch scheduler for resource allocation and uses a variety of configuration options to control job behavior, including:\\n\\n* **Resource Allocation:** Specifies the number of nodes and GPUs required for the job, and sets the walltime limit.\\n* **Task Management:** Defines a priority-ordered list of task folders, specifies the maximum number of tasks to launch, and controls how many tasks can run concurrently.\\n* **Job Control:** Sets flags for looping behavior, sleep times, and verbosity level.\\n* **Task Selection:** Allows for sorting and filtering of tasks, as well as handling tasks that are stolen by other jobs.\\n\\nThe script uses the `launch.sh` script within the `metaq` folder to launch the actual tasks. Note that anything after `source ${METAQ}/x/launch.sh` might not execute if the wall clock time is exceeded before all tasks are launched.\"\n}\n```"
