        "script_description": "This script runs GROMACS simulations on multiple processors. It uses PBS to allocate resources and OpenMPI to manage parallel execution. The script iterates through directories containing GROMACS simulation data and runs a series of molecular dynamics simulations, utilizing a deformation configuration file (grompp_deform.mdp) and a specified number of OpenMP threads (20). It logs the progress of the simulations to a file named according to the job ID.",
        "script_execution": "The script first checks if the necessary directories and files are present. If they are, it sets up the OpenMPI environment and then iterates through the directories, running GROMACS simulations for each directory."
