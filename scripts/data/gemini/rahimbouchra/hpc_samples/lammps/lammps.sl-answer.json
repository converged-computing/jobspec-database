    "application": "LAMMPS",
    "details": "The script is running a molecular dynamics simulation using the LAMMPS software. It utilizes the following software and resources:\n\n* **LAMMPS:**  Version 7Aug2019-foss-2019b-Python-3.7.4-kokkos is loaded via the `module load` command.\n* **SLURM:** The script utilizes the SLURM workload manager to run the simulation on a cluster. It requests 16 tasks (processes) spread across multiple cores.  The partition \"shortq\" is used, implying a shorter runtime for the job.\n* **MPI:** The `mpirun` command is used to launch LAMMPS, indicating the use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel execution.\n* **Input File:** The simulation is driven by the `indent.in.min` input file. The script copies the input file and other potentially required resources from the user's current working directory to a dedicated work directory within the user's data space. This ensures a well-organized and isolated environment for the simulation."
