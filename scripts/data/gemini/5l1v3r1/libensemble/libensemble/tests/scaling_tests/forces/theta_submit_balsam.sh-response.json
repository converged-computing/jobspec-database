It requires the following:\\n\\n* Balsam installed and a database initialized.\\n* Conda environment with libEnsemble and other required libraries.\\n* A COBALT queue system to submit the job.\\n* A user script `run_libe_forces.py` that uses libEnsemble.  This script launches a Balsam job with a manager and workers.  The manager runs on one node and the workers run on the remaining nodes in the pool.  The workers submit tasks to the manager, which then distributes them to the other nodes.  The script also includes options for hyperthreading libEnsemble, and plotting results using Balsam and libEnsemble metrics.\"\n}\n```"
