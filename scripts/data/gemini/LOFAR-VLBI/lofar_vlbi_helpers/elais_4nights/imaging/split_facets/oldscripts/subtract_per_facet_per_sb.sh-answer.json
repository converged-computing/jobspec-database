    "description": "The script is written for Slurm workload manager and runs a batch job with the following parameters:\n\n* **-c 10**: requests 10 cores.\n* **--job-name=subtract**: sets the job name to \"subtract\".\n* **--array=0-40%4**: submits an array job with 10 tasks, numbered from 0 to 40 with a step of 4.\n* **--constraint=amd**: specifies that the job should be run on AMD nodes.\n* **--mail-type=FAIL**: requests email notification only in case of job failure.\n* **--mail-user=jurjendejong@strw.leidenuniv.nl**: sets the email address for notifications.\n\nThe script then copies data into a folder named \"facet_${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}\" and executes a loop that processes data for each night. Inside the loop, another script, \"subtract_sb.sh\", is submitted as a separate job using \"sbatch\" for each data file (SB) within each night directory. The script looks for the \"sub_<RESOLUTION>*.ms\" files in the specified output folder structure as the final results."
