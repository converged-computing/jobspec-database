This is evident from the script's directory structure (`/gpfs/scratch/lnsmith/deepLearning/caffe/9-11-17/`) and commands like `./examples/bk_imagenet/queues/resnet/btrain2.sh`.\n* **Software:**  The script loads several libraries and modules:\n    * **glog and gflags:** These are used for logging and command-line flag parsing, commonly used in C++ projects like Caffe.\n    * **protobuf:** A language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Caffe leverages Protobuf for defining its model structures.\n    * **boost:** A collection of C++ libraries offering a wide range of tools and utilities, commonly used by Caffe.\n    * **lmdb and leveldb:** Key-value stores frequently used for storing data in deep learning frameworks.\n    * **opencv-3.4.0:** An open-source library for computer vision tasks, often used for image processing and analysis in deep learning.\n* **Resources:**  The PBS directives (starting with `#PBS`) specify the resource requirements for running the script on a cluster:\n    * **walltime:** Maximum runtime of the job (72 hours).\n    * **select:** Number of nodes (1), CPUs per node (24), MPI processes (24), GPUs per node (4), and PowerAI support (enabled).\n    * **place:**  Scattered allocation of resources, excluding other jobs.\n    * **N:** Job name (`ResIm50E1`).\n    * **j:** Job disposition (`oe`: merge standard output and standard error).\n    * **V:**  Pass environment variables to the job.\n    * **q:** Queue to submit the job to (`standard`).\n    * **A:**  Account to charge for the job (`MHPCC96650NRL`).\n* **Script commands:** The main commands executed by the script:\n    * Change directory to the Caffe installation.\n    * Run `btrain2.sh`, likely responsible for training a deep learning model.\n    * Submit another job (`mbqsub2.pbs`) using `qsub`, potentially for further processing or evaluation.\n\n**Note:**  The commented out lines suggest the possibility of using additional modules like Anaconda and Caffe 5.0 in the past, but they are not currently being used in the script. \n"
