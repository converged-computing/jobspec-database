    "application": "batch_scheduler",
    "details": "The script runs a batch job submission command, likely on a high-performance computing (HPC) system like Euler. It uses the 'bsub' command, which suggests a batch system like LSF (Load Sharing Facility). The script requires the following software: \n- cmake: a build system generator\n- open_mpi: a message passing interface implementation for parallel computing. It also relies on external files 'num_nodes.txt' and 'overall_runtime_minutes.txt' for configuration parameters."
