It uses the following software and resources:\\n\\n* **SLURM:** The Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is a job scheduler that allows users to submit, manage, and execute jobs on a cluster. This script uses SLURM directives to specify job parameters such as the job name, project, number of nodes, number of tasks, number of GPUs, and wallclock time.\\n* **CUDA:** The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-purpose computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). This script loads the CUDA toolkit and drivers to enable GPU acceleration.\\n* **cuDNN:** The NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. This script loads cuDNN to optimize deep learning performance.\\n* **Conda:** Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that simplifies the installation and management of software packages and their dependencies. This script uses Conda to activate a specific environment containing the Pointcept model and its dependencies.\\n* **Pointcept:** Pointcept is a semantic segmentation model that uses a SpUNet architecture. The script uses the Pointcept model for training.\\n* **Python:** Python is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used in machine learning and deep learning. The script uses Python to execute the training script.\\n* **OpenMPI:** Open MPI is a high-performance message passing interface (MPI) implementation that is used for parallel computing. The script uses OpenMPI to run the Pointcept model in parallel across multiple GPUs.\\n\\nThe script also uses environment variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to control GPU visibility and OpenMP threads, respectively.\"\n}\n```"
