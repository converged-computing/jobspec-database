    "application": "Slurm",
    "details": "The script uses the Slurm Workload Manager to run a python application. It requests one node with two GPUs, a maximum runtime of 24 hours, and six CPUs per task. It then loads the Intel and OpenMPI modules and executes the python script 'fcgrnn_train.py' with various parameters for training a deep learning model. It uses the 'wait' command to ensure the script runs until completion.  The script appears to be a machine learning application that utilizes a deep learning model called 'fcgrnn' for training with parameters like 'seq_len', 'horizon', 'num_gpus', 'learning_rate', and 'loss_func'. It further utilizes 'CUDA' and 'cuDNN' for GPU acceleration. The specific deep learning framework or library used by the script is not explicitly specified in the provided script. "
