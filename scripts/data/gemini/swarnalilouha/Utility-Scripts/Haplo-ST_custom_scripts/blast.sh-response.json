It leverages the PBS (Portable Batch System) to manage the execution of the BLAST jobs on a cluster.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script and its requirements:\n\n* **BLAST+**: The BLAST+ suite is used for sequence alignment. The script uses version 2.7.1, which is loaded through the module system.\n* **PBS**: PBS is a batch system used for queuing and executing jobs on a cluster. The script submits a job named 'j-blast1' requesting:\n    * **nodes=1:ppn=4:AMD**: One node with four processors (ppn) utilizing AMD architecture.\n    * **q=batch**: The job is submitted to the 'batch' queue.\n    * **walltime=48:00:00**: The job is allowed to run for a maximum of 48 hours.\n    * **mem=8gb**: The job requires 8GB of memory.\n* **BLAST Database**: The script references a pre-existing BLAST database named 'db_blast'. \n* **Input Sequences**: The script analyzes a set of sequences stored in a directory named './sequences', using a loop to process each file sequentially.\n* **Output**: The results of the BLAST analysis are written to a directory named './blast_matches' with each file named after the corresponding query sequence.\n* **Output Format**: The script specifies the output format using the '-outfmt \"7 qseqid qlen sseqid slen pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore sseq\"' option. This provides detailed information about each alignment, including query and subject sequence identifiers, lengths, percentage identity, alignment lengths, mismatches, gaps, alignment start and end positions, e-value, bitscore, and subject sequence.\n* **Threads**: The '-num_threads 4' option utilizes four threads for parallel processing, taking advantage of the multi-core CPU. \n"
