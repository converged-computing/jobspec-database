It is designed to run various execution tests on different GEOS-Chem run directories. The script can be executed interactively or through schedulers like LSF or SLURM. The script utilizes a number of environment variables and functions, including:\\n\\n* **itRoot:** The root directory of the GEOS-Chem integration tests.\\n* **BIN_DIR:** Directory containing the executable binaries.\\n* **ENV_DIR:** Directory containing environment files.\\n* **codeDir:** Directory containing the source code of GEOS-Chem.\\n* **logsDir:** Directory to store logs.\\n* **rundirsDir:** Directory containing various run directories.\\n* **site:** The name of the compute site (e.g., XANNON for Harvard Cannon, XCOMPUTE1 for WashU Compute1).\\n* **SLURM_JOBID:** ID of the job submitted to SLURM.\\n* **LSB_JOBID:** ID of the job submitted to LSF.\\n* **OMP_NUM_THREADS:** The number of threads to be used for OpenMP parallelization.\\n* **OMP_STACKSIZE:** The maximum stack size for each thread.\\n* **count_rundirs:** A function to count the number of run directories.\\n* **is_gchp_rundir:** A function to determine if a directory is a valid GEOS-Chem run directory.\\n* **exe_name:** A function to get the name of the executable file for a given run directory.\\n* **cleanRunDir.sh:** A script to remove leftover files in a run directory.\\n* **setEnvironmentLink.sh:** A script to link to the environment file.\\n* **setCommonRunSettings.sh:** A script to update configuration files and set links.\\n* **setRestartLink.sh:** A script to set links to restart files.\\n* **checkRunSettings.sh:** A script to perform sanity checks on run settings.\\n\\nThe script also uses specific commands based on the scheduler used. For example, on SLURM, it uses `srun` to execute GEOS-Chem, while on LSF, it uses `mpiexec`. It also uses environment variables specific to each scheduler, like `SLURM_JOBID` and `LSB_JOBID`, to identify the job and control resource allocation. The script is highly customized for the specific needs and environment of GEOS-Chem development and testing, including features for restarting simulations, cleaning up run directories, and linking to environment files. The script also uses a variety of functions and scripts to ensure the proper execution and testing of GEOS-Chem in different environments.\"\n}\n```"
