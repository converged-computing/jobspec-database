    "application": "LAMMPS",
    "details": "The script runs the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package. It utilizes the SLURM workload manager for resource allocation and management. The script requests 4 tasks (processes) and allocates one task per core. It specifies the 'defq' partition for job submission and requires nodes with Infiniband interconnect. The script also sets up a working directory on the scratch filesystem and copies input files from the current directory. Finally, it runs LAMMPS with the 'myInput.in' input file."
