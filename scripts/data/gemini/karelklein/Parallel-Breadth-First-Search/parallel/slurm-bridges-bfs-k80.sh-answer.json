    "details": "This script runs a PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) application named 'test_bfs' which is likely a breadth-first search algorithm. It utilizes a K80 GPU, runs for a maximum of 5 minutes on one node, and requires the 'petsc/cse6230-double' module from '/home/tisaac/opt/modulesfiles'. Additionally, the script uses a 'Makefile.cuda' to compile the code. The script includes git commands to obtain the current commit hash and check for any uncommitted changes."
