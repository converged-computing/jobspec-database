    "details": "This script is a SLURM job submission script for running applications on a cluster using AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs and NVIDIA A100 GPUs. It leverages SLURM to manage resources and specifies various parameters such as the number of nodes, GPUs, wall time, and the desired environment. The script allows for the execution of both OpenMP and MPI applications. It utilizes the 'module' command to load necessary modules and provides options for defining the application's executable path, run options, and working directory. Additionally, it supports setting environment variables for OpenMP and MPI configurations."
