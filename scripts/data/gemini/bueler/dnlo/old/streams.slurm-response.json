The script leverages SLURM's job submission system (using `#SBATCH` directives) to request resources like:\n    * **Partition**: `t1standard` (a specific resource pool on the cluster)\n    * **Tasks**:  64 (total number of CPU cores requested)\n    * **Tasks per node**: 8 (specifying how many cores per node are required)\n    * **Email**:  `elbueler@alaska.edu` (to receive job status updates)\n    * **Output**:  `slurm.%j` (a file to store job output)\n\n* **mpirun**: This is likely used to launch a parallel application (MPI program) across the allocated nodes. The script generates a machine file (`./nodes.$SLURM_JOB_ID`) containing the list of nodes assigned to the job. This file is then passed to `mpirun` to distribute the application across those nodes.\n\n* **make**: The `make streams` command suggests that this script is part of a larger build process.  It likely uses a `Makefile` to compile and build the MPI program before running it with `mpirun`.\n\n* **hostname**:  This command is used within the script to generate the list of nodes for the machine file.\n\nIn summary, this script is designed to run a parallel MPI application on a SLURM cluster, taking advantage of the distributed resources offered by the cluster. \n"
