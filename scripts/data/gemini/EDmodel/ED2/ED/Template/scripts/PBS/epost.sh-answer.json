    "Details": "This script is a bash script designed to run R scripts for analyzing ecological data. It defines parameters and settings for different R scripts like 'plot_yearly.r', 'plot_monthly.r', 'plot_census.r', etc. The script iterates through polygons defined in a 'joborder.txt' file, sets up input parameters for each polygon based on the joborder, and then copies the appropriate R script to the polygon's directory. It then prepares a submission script for each polygon, setting options such as runtime, memory, and number of CPUs, and submits the job to a queue if the 'submit' variable is set to 'y' or 'l'. The script uses a loop to retry submission if the first attempt fails, with a maximum number of retries defined by 'nsubtry_max'. The script also defines several environmental variables for the R scripts, such as 'thispoly' (name of the polygon), 'thisoutroot' (main output directory), 'thisrscpath' (path with R scripts), 'thispovincs' (path with POV-Ray include files), 'thisyeara' (first year to use), 'thisyearz' (last year to use), 'thismontha' (first month), 'thismonthz' (last month), 'thisdatea' (first day), 'thisdatez' (last day), 'thishoura' (first hour), 'thishourz' (last hour), 'thisminua' (first minute), 'thisminuz' (last minute), 'thisseasonmona' (first season month), 'myphysiol' (physiology scheme), 'myallom' (allometry scheme), 'myslhydro' (soil hydrological scheme), 'mydroughtmark' (flag for drought), 'mydroughtyeara' (first drought year), 'mydroughtyearz' (last drought year), 'mymonthsdrought' (drought months), 'myvarcycle' (variable cycle), 'thisoutform' (output format), 'mydistrib' (distribution), 'mymetcyca' (first met cycle year), 'mymetcycz' (last met cycle year), 'mybiocyca' (first biometry cycle year), 'mybiocycz' (last biometry cycle year), 'myidbhtype' (DBH class), 'mybackground' (background colour), 'mycorrection' (respiration correction factor), 'myiintphoto' (integration interval), 'myklight' (light extinction coefficient), 'myefttrim' (trim for tower years), 'myoldgrowth' (old-growth flag), 'myeftyeara' (first tower year), and 'myeftyearz' (last tower year).",
