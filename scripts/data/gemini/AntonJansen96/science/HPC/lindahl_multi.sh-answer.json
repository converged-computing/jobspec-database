        "The script runs a molecular dynamics simulation using Gromacs, a popular software package for simulating molecular systems.",
        "It uses the SLURM workload manager to allocate resources on a cluster.",
        "The script requests 4 GPUs and compiles a custom version of Gromacs using cmake, gcc, and cuda.",
        "It then runs four simulations simultaneously on the GPUs, each using a separate CPU core.",
        "The script uses the FFTW library for fast Fourier transforms.",
        "It also utilizes the SLURM environment variables for job management and resource allocation.",
        "After the simulations are complete, the script resubmits itself to run another set of simulations."
