It utilizes Singularity containers to create a consistent environment and distributes the workload across multiple nodes. The script dynamically allocates threads to each node based on the configured number of clients and threads per node, ensuring efficient resource utilization. It also handles communication between the server and clients through SSH and dynamically assigns ports and IPs for communication."
