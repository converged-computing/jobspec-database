        "SLURM": "This script uses SLURM to manage the job submission and resource allocation. It requests one node with a specific number of tasks per socket and CPUs per task. It also utilizes a GPU and specifies the time limit, job name, and queue.",
        "GROMACS": "The script uses GROMACS, a molecular dynamics simulation package, to perform various simulations including energy minimization, NVT, NPT, and production runs. It utilizes specific MDP files for each simulation step and employs features like -deffnm and -ntomp to control the output and number of threads.",
        "bash": "The script is written in bash, a Unix shell, which allows for scripting, loop iterations, and file manipulation. It leverages features like echo, cd, and for loops to execute commands and navigate the directory structure."
    },
    "requirements": {
        "GPU": "The script requests a single GPU and uses the '-update gpu' flag to enable GPU acceleration in GROMACS.",
        "CPU": "The script utilizes multiple CPUs per task and uses the 'ntomp' flag to control the number of threads used in GROMACS.",
        "memory": "The script requires sufficient memory for the GROMACS simulations. The specific memory requirements depend on the system size and simulation parameters.",
        "disk space": "The script needs enough disk space to store the input files, simulation outputs, and intermediate files.",
        "network": "The script may require network access for downloading files, uploading results, or communicating with other systems."
