    "details": "The script is a SLURM job submission script. It uses SLURM commands to allocate resources and run a job on a cluster. The script requires CUDA 10.2, PyTorch 1.10.0 (GPU version), and Python 3.7 to be loaded on the cluster nodes. It also utilizes a script called `am_onehot_run.sh`, which is likely responsible for executing the main application.  The script also utilizes a few other modules (biopython, for example) but these are commented out."
