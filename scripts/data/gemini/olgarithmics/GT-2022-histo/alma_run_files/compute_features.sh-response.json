The `#SBATCH` directives at the beginning of the script are used to specify the resources required for the job, such as the number of nodes, tasks, CPUs, time limit, output and error file locations, and GPU resources. \n\nThe script also loads the **Mamba** package manager and activates the **dl_torch** environment, which suggests that the script is likely running a Python script that utilizes the **PyTorch** deep learning framework. \n\nThe main function of the script appears to be running the `compute_feats_res.py` script, which is likely involved in extracting features from patches (presumably images) and storing them in the specified output directory.\n\nThe script uses a number of specific directories and files that are not readily available from the code alone. These paths suggest that the script is running on a dedicated computing environment with specific data storage locations.\n"
