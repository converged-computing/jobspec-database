It utilizes the following resources:\n\n* **Nodes:** 1\n* **Processors per Node:** 8\n* **Virtual Memory:** 100 GB\n* **Walltime:** 140 hours\n\nThe script also requires the following modules to be loaded:\n\n* **fastqc:** Used for quality control of sequencing reads.\n* **python/3.6.1:** The Python version required by Guppy.\n\nThe script utilizes two configuration files:\n\n* **dna_r9.4.1_450bps.cfg:** This configuration file is used by Guppy to perform basecalling.\n* **configuration.cfg:** This configuration file is used by Guppy barcoder to perform demultiplexing of barcoded reads.\n\nThe script performs the following tasks:\n\n* Basecalling of raw FAST5 files using Guppy.\n* Demultiplexing of barcoded reads using Guppy barcoder.\n* Quality control of the basecalled reads using FastQC.\n\nThe script is set up to process several runs of sequencing data, with each run having its own directory for FAST5 files, basecalled reads, and barcoded reads. The script also has a section for merging the barcoded reads into individual files based on barcode. Finally, the script also includes a section for filtering the reads using NanoFilt.\n"
