It requests a specific GPU partition ('gpu-titanxp'), a runtime of 48 hours, 4 GPUs, 4 tasks (each with 1 CPU), and specifies the location of the training script with the command 'python3 train.py'. It also uses srun commands to print hostname, current working directory, and the date before and after training."
