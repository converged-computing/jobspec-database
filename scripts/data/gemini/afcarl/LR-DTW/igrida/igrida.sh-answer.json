    "details": "The script is designed to run on the OAR (Open Application Resource) cluster management system. It uses the OAR directives to specify resource requirements, such as the amount of memory, the number of nodes and cores, the wall time, and the location of output and error files. It also specifies an array parameter file and uses the OAR job id for file naming. The script then sets the working directory, executes a compiled executable file called test_1nn, and passes any arguments to the executable."
