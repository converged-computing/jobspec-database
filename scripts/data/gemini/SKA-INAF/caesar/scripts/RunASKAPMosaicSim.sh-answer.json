    "details": "This script appears to be designed for a CASA-based pipeline, performing a skymodel simulation followed by mosaicking. It makes extensive use of CASA's command line interface, including the 'casa' command and Python scripts. Here is a breakdown of the script's functionalities and resource requirements:\n\n**Skymodel Simulation:**\n- The script leverages a CASA Python script (`generate_ps_map.py`) to generate a sky model for each beam.\n- It takes input parameters like the desired number of sources, flux density range, and source density to control the simulation.\n- It creates output files for the sky model, source catalog, and a DS9 region file.\n\n**Mosaicking:**\n- The script uses the CASA `linmos-mpi` tool for mosaicking.  \n- It takes as input a list of residual images, restored images, and weight images for each beam.\n- It constructs a `linmos` parset file specifying the input images, weights, and output filename.\n- It generates a shell script to run the `linmos-mpi` command.\n\n**Containerization (Optional):**\n- The script offers the option to run the simulation and mosaicking process inside a Singularity container.\n- This option requires specifying the path to the container image (`--containerimg`) and any additional options to be passed to the container (`--containeroptions`).\n\n**Batch Submission (Optional):**\n- The script supports submitting the processing tasks to a batch system (e.g., PBS).\n- The user needs to specify the queue name (`--queue`), wall time (`--jobwalltime`), memory requirement (`--jobmemory`), and optionally the job user group (`--jobusergroup`).\n\n**Other Resources:**\n- The script requires the CASAPATH environment variable to be set.\n- It assumes the presence of a script directory (`$CAESAR_SCRIPTS_DIR`) containing the CASA Python script used for sky model generation.\n- It utilizes tools like `readlink`, `wc`, `basename`, `paste`, and shell scripting for file manipulation and execution control.\n\n**Overall, this script provides a flexible framework for simulating and mosaicking astronomical data, potentially utilizing CASA and Singularity containers for execution on a batch system.**"
