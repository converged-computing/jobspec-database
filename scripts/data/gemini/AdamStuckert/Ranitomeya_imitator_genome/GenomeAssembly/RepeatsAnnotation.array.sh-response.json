It leverages pre-built vertebrate repeat libraries along with species-specific libraries.\n2. **Gene Prediction:** The script utilizes Maker, a comprehensive annotation pipeline, to predict gene structures. It uses evidence from ESTs, proteins, and ab-initio predictions from SNAP and Augustus.\n3. **Training Gene Prediction Software:** SNAP and Augustus are trained on the gene models produced by Maker to improve their accuracy in subsequent rounds of annotation.\n4. **Multiple Rounds of Annotation:** The script iterates through multiple rounds of annotation, using the refined gene models from previous rounds as input for the next. This iterative process aims to achieve better annotation quality.\n5. **Merging Results:** The script merges the results of multiple Maker runs, including transcripts, proteins, and GFF3 files, to produce a consolidated annotation.\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n* **Genome Assembly:** A high-quality genome assembly in FASTA format is essential.\n* **ESTs:** A set of ESTs or assembled mRNA-seq reads in FASTA format is used to improve gene prediction.\n* **Proteins:** A protein database (e.g., Uniprot) is needed for homology-based gene prediction.\n* **Repeat Libraries:** Repeat libraries, such as vertebrate libraries and species-specific libraries, are used to identify and mask repetitive elements.\n* **Uniprot Database:** The Uniprot database is used for functional annotation of predicted genes.\n* **Conda Environment:** A conda environment is used to manage dependencies and software versions.\n\nThe script also utilizes various computational resources, including:\n\n* **CPU cores:**  Several steps, particularly RepeatMasker and Maker, require a significant number of CPU cores to run efficiently.\n* **Memory:** Some steps, like RepeatModeler2 and Augustus, require a large amount of memory.\n* **Disk space:** The script generates a large volume of intermediate and final files, requiring sufficient disk space.\n\nThis comprehensive annotation pipeline and its resource requirements highlight the complexity and computational intensity of modern genome annotation workflows. \n"
