    "details": "This script utilizes SAIGE for genetic association analysis. It's run within a Singularity container, leveraging resources from the SLURM workload manager. The script utilizes several system variables like SLURM_JOB_ID, SLURM_JOB_NODELIST, and SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK. It also sets the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS based on available CPU cores. Additionally, the script specifies input and output files for SAIGE analysis, defining paths to genotype data, batch files, and SAIGE model files. Post-processing is done with commands like 'cut' and 'gzip' to format the output data."
