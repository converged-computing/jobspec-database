The script uses the following Slurm commands to specify job parameters: \\n\\n* **--job-name:** Sets the job name to 'clean_data' for easy identification in the cluster. \\n* **--mail-user:** Specifies the email address to receive notifications about the job, in this case, 'ianbstew@umich.edu'. \\n* **--mail-type:** Configures the type of notifications to receive, including 'BEGIN' (when the job starts) and 'END' (when the job finishes). \\n* **--time:** Sets the maximum runtime for the job to 10 hours. \\n* **--account:** Assigns the job to the 'mihalcea0' account, likely associated with a user or research group on the cluster. \\n* **--output:** Defines the location for storing the job's standard output log file, which will be in the user's home directory under 'logs' with a filename based on the job name and ID. \\n* **--nodes:** Requests one node for the job, meaning it will run on a single physical machine. \\n* **--partition:** Specifies the 'standard' partition for the job, indicating it will be scheduled on a standard set of compute nodes. \\n* **--mem-per-cpu:** Reserves 150 GB of memory per CPU core on the allocated node. \\n\\nThe script then defines several variables to control data paths, filenames, and parameters related to the data cleaning process. It also sets environment variables `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE` and `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` to 1, suggesting that it's intended to run on a server without internet access. The final line of the script executes the Python script `clean_data_for_generation.py` with the specified parameters. This Python script is likely responsible for cleaning and preparing data for some sort of text generation task, possibly using a large language model. The use of `--model_type` suggests that different model types might be supported by the script. \\n\\nThe script also includes commented-out sections for alternative execution scenarios, including running on a regular server and using different data sources.  It's worth noting that the script likely relies on external Python packages, particularly those related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text generation.\"\n}\n```"
