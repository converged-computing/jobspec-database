The workflow utilizes the following software:\n\n* **Hermes:** A distributed, high-throughput computing framework used for molecular dynamics simulations.\n* **OpenMM:** A high-performance molecular simulation library used for molecular dynamics simulations.\n* **PyTorch:** A deep learning framework used for training machine learning models.\n* **SLURM:** A workload manager used for scheduling jobs on a cluster.\n* **Bash:** A Unix shell used for running commands.\n\nThe script requires the following resources:\n\n* **GPU (A100):**  Nvidia A100 GPUs for accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and deep learning training.\n* **MPI:** Message Passing Interface for distributed computing.\n* **NFS and PFS:** Network File Systems for shared storage.\n* **Conda:** A package manager used to manage software environments.\n* **Python:** A programming language used for running the DeepDriveMD workflow.\n\nThe script utilizes the SLURM batch system to run on a cluster. It requests specific resources (e.g., partition, account, time, nodes, number of tasks) for the job. \n\nThe workflow consists of several stages:\n\n* **Molecular Dynamics (OpenMM):** The script executes molecular dynamics simulations using OpenMM.\n* **Aggregation:** Data from the molecular dynamics simulations is aggregated.\n* **Training:** Machine learning models are trained using PyTorch based on the aggregated data.\n* **Inference:** Trained models are used to make predictions.\n\nThe script utilizes Hermes for distributed computing and data transfer. Hermes is configured to use specific network devices and settings.  The script also manages the Hermes daemon to ensure proper communication and coordination between nodes. \n"
