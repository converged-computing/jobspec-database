This is a computational code for ab-initio quantum mechanical simulations.\n* **Software:** The script utilizes several software components:\n    * **Intel Compiler 2019.1.144:**  This compiler is used to build the VASP executable.\n    * **OpenMPI 4.0.1:** This is a message passing interface library used for parallel computing, enabling VASP to run efficiently on multiple processors.\n    * **VASP 5.4.4:** This is the specific version of VASP being run.\n* **Resources:** The script requests several resources from the cluster management system (likely SLURM) to execute VASP:\n    * **Nodes:** 1 node is requested, meaning VASP will run on a single compute node.\n    * **Tasks:** 16 tasks are requested, indicating that VASP will be executed across 16 parallel processes.\n    * **CPUs per Task:** 1 CPU is allocated per task. This means each process will run on a single CPU core.\n    * **Memory per CPU:** 1000 MB of memory is requested for each CPU. \n    * **Queue:** The script targets the \"hennig\" queue, which likely represents a specific set of resources or priorities within the cluster.\n    * **Walltime:** The script requests a maximum runtime of 6 hours (6:00:00). \n\n**Note:** This script uses the `srun` command to execute VASP. This is a common way to launch parallel jobs in high-performance computing environments using tools like SLURM. The `job.log` file will contain the output from the VASP run. \n"
