    "details": "The script utilizes the Slurm workload manager to run a training job on a single node with 256 tasks per node, utilizing the 'sequana_gpu_shared' partition. It requires a GPU for training, specifically CUDA 11.1 and cuDNN 8.2. The script uses Python 3.9.1, gcc 7.4, and the sequana environment to execute the training process. The training is logged with WandB, storing checkpoints in a designated backup directory."
