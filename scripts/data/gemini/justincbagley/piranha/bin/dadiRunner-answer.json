    "application": "dadiRunner",
    "details": "The script `dadiRunner.sh` is designed to automate the process of running demographic models in the software package `dadi` (Gutenkunst et al. 2009) on a remote supercomputing cluster. It utilizes a configuration file `dadi_runner.cfg` to gather information about the supercomputer, the destination path for the run folders, and other necessary details. The script is compatible with \u2202a\u2202i v1.7+ and the \u2202a\u2202i-mod v1.6.3 version from Tine et al. (2014), which can be installed in a Python virtual environment. It requires passwordless SSH access to the supercomputer and certain dependencies like Python and associated packages. This script is a part of a larger project called PIrANHA, which focuses on population genetic analysis.",
    "resource_requirements": "The script utilizes the following resources and requirements:\n\n* **Software Dependencies:**\n    * `dadi` (version 1.7+ or \u2202a\u2202i-mod v1.6.3)\n    * Python (with necessary packages)\n    * SSH (with passwordless access)\n* **Configuration File:** `dadi_runner.cfg`\n* **Input Files:**\n    * SNP data input file (in \u2202a\u2202i format)\n    * .py files containing the demographic models\n* **Supercomputing Cluster:** Access to a supercomputing cluster with a queue submission system\n* **File System:** Adequate space on the local machine and the supercomputer for storing the run folders, script files, and output data\n* **Network Connectivity:** Stable network connection between the local machine and the supercomputer."
