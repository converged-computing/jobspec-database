This is indicated by the `#!/bin/sh` shebang line and the lines starting with `#PBS`. These lines define parameters like the job name, resource requirements (nodes, processors, walltime), queue, email options, and the location of the job script.\n* **Software:** The script relies on various software packages:\n    * **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):** Version 4.6.4 is loaded using a specific module.\n    * **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture):** Version 5.5.22 is used for GPU computations, with its paths added to the environment variables.\n    * **Python:** Version 2.7.6 is used, and its path is added to the environment.\n    * **CMake:** It's used for building the project, but its version is not specified in the script.\n    * **nvidia-smi:** It's used to gather information about the GPU.\n* **Python Modules:** The script uses the `halfshear-darcy-starter.py` module for running specific simulations. This module likely handles the simulation logic and interaction with the CUDA library.\n* **Resource Requirements:**\n    * The script requires one node with 3 processors.\n    * The maximum runtime allowed for the job is 48 hours.\n    * The job is submitted to the `qfermi` queue. \n* **Script Functionality:**\n    * The script sets up the environment by loading required software modules and configuring the paths for various libraries and Python modules.\n    * It then defines the working directory and copies the project files to that directory.\n    * It uses `cmake` to build the project and runs the `halfshear-darcy-starter.py` module with specific parameters.\n    * The script starts the python scripts in the background using the `&` operator.\n    * The `wait` command ensures that the script waits for all the background processes to finish before proceeding.\n    * The script finally prints the start and end times of the job.\n\nThis script is likely for running GPU-accelerated simulations, potentially related to fluid dynamics or a similar field, based on the module names and script arguments. \n"
