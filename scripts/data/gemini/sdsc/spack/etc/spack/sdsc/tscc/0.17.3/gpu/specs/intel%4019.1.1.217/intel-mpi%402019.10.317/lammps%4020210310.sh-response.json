It requires the following software:\n\n* **Spack 0.17.3** - This is a package manager used to manage software installations.\n* **Intel Compiler 19.1.1.217** - This is the compiler used to build LAMMPS.\n* **Intel MPI 2019.10.317** - This is the MPI library used for parallel processing in LAMMPS.\n* **CUDA 11.2.2** - This is the CUDA library used for GPU acceleration in LAMMPS.\n* **FFTW 3.3.10** - This is the Fast Fourier Transform library used in LAMMPS.\n* **Kokkos 3.4.01** - This is the parallel programming framework used in LAMMPS.\n* **ffmpeg 4.3.2** - This is the video encoding library used in LAMMPS.\n* **Plumed 2.6.3** - This is the enhanced sampling library used in LAMMPS.\n* **Python 3.8.12** - This is the Python interpreter used in LAMMPS.\n* **Intel MKL 2020.4.304** - This is the Intel Math Kernel Library used in LAMMPS.\n\nThe script runs on a system using the **Slurm scheduler**, which is a workload manager used for allocating resources on a cluster. The script also requires a **CUDA-enabled GPU**, which is used to accelerate the simulations. \n\nThe script utilizes the `spack` command to install and configure the required software packages and their dependencies. It sets up the environment by loading necessary modules and configuring the environment variables. The `spack spec` command checks the specifications of the LAMMPS package, including its dependencies and variants. It then installs LAMMPS using the `spack install` command, which specifies the compiler, variants, and dependencies. \n\nThe script also sets up the environment variables needed to run the LAMMPS simulation. For example, `CUDA_CUDA_LIBRARY` is set to point to the path of the CUDA library. The `CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` is set to include the CUDA library path, which is crucial for finding the necessary libraries during the build process. \n\nThe script utilizes `module` commands to load and unload necessary modules. It also uses `echo` commands to print information about the job, such as the job ID, time, and script hash. The `time` command measures the execution time of the `spack install` command. \n\nThis script is tailored for a specific system configuration and may require adjustments depending on your setup. \n"
