    "application": "Singularity",
    "details": "The script runs within a Singularity container, requiring the `singularity` command line tool. The container image is named `singularity_auto_annotate.sif` and is likely stored at `/projects/ovcare/classification/singularity_modules/singularity_auto_annotate`. It uses a bash script for running parallel jobs via SLURM. This requires the SLURM workload manager. The script leverages a Python application `app.py` and requires several external libraries, likely installed within the Singularity container. It also uses resources such as CUDA for GPU processing and requires sufficient memory, as indicated by the `--mem=6G` parameter."
