The script utilizes Slurm directives to manage resources like CPUs, GPUs, memory, and time.\n* **CUDA:** A parallel computing platform and API for Nvidia GPUs, enabling accelerated computations crucial for deep learning.\n* **Nvidia-smi:** A utility to monitor and manage Nvidia GPUs, providing information like usage and temperature.\n* **Bash:** The script is written in Bash, a common shell scripting language.\n* **Transformer-Domain-Generalization:** A library/framework specific to this deep learning project, likely providing the model architecture, training algorithms, and evaluation metrics.\n\nThe `resources` section outlines the hardware and software resources needed to run this training:\n\n* **2 CPUs:** Used for general computation and auxiliary tasks.\n* **1 GPU:**  A single GPU is requested for accelerated matrix operations and the training process.\n* **32GB of RAM:** A significant amount of memory needed to hold the model, data, and other program variables.\n* **7 days:** The script is allocated 7 days of running time for training. \n* **`gpu,gpub` partition:** This specifies the Slurm partition that the job should run on, likely associated with a cluster of nodes equipped with GPUs.\n\nThis setup suggests the script is part of a larger deep learning project that involves complex models and lengthy training times. The script uses a combination of tools and resources to manage the training process efficiently on a cluster environment. \n"
