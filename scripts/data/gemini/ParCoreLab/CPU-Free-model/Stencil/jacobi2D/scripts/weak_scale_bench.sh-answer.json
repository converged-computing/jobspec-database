    "application": "Slurm",
    "description": "The script is a Slurm job submission script that runs a stencil benchmark, likely a Jacobi iteration for solving partial differential equations. It performs experiments with varying grid sizes, number of GPUs, and different implementation variants of the stencil computation (e.g., baseline copy, single stream, double stream, NVSHMEM variants). It measures execution time and performs multiple runs for each configuration.",

        "The script utilizes a 'modules.sh' script to load necessary environment variables.",
        "It has a number of parameters that can be set through command line arguments, including the number of iterations, number of runs, and starting and maximum grid sizes."
