This indicates that the script is intended to run on a Slurm-managed HPC environment.\n* **Bash:** The script is written in the Bash scripting language, evident from the `#!/bin/bash` shebang line.\n* **MPI:** The script utilizes `mpirun` to execute the `jacobi_nvshmem` binary, which implies MPI (Message Passing Interface) is used for parallel processing.\n* **jacobi and jacobi_nvshmem:** These binaries are likely the core executables performing the stencil benchmark. The naming suggests they are related to the Jacobi iterative method, a common algorithm in numerical linear algebra.\n* **GPU:** The script uses `--gres=gpu:8` to request 8 GPUs for execution, indicating that the stencil benchmark is designed to leverage GPU acceleration.\n* **CPU:** The script also utilizes `-n 8` and `-c 16` to request 8 nodes and 16 cores per node, showcasing its reliance on CPUs as well.\n* **Network:** MPI communication requires network connectivity for efficient data exchange between nodes and processes.\n* **Slurm:** As mentioned before, the script relies heavily on Slurm for resource allocation, job submission, and management, highlighting its use in an HPC setting. \n"
