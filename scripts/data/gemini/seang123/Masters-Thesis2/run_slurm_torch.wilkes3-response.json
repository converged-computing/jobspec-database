These directives specify things like the number of nodes, GPUs, wallclock time, and email notifications. \n* **Python:** The script is written in Bash and uses the Python interpreter (`python`) to execute the application. \n* **CUDA and cuDNN:**  The script loads these modules for GPU acceleration. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-purpose computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). cuDNN is a library that accelerates deep neural networks, specifically those using NVIDIA GPUs. \n* **OpenMPI:** While the script doesn't explicitly use OpenMPI commands, the comment suggests it can be used for MPI-based applications.  OpenMPI is a high-performance message-passing library used for parallel computing. \n* **OpenMP:** The script mentions OpenMP and sets the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. OpenMP is an API that supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran.\n\nThe script also utilizes various resources:\n\n* **GPUs:**  The `--gres=gpu:1` directive in the SLURM section indicates that the job requires a single GPU per node.\n* **CPUs:** The script uses CPUs for managing the workload and running the Python application. \n* **Memory:** The script uses memory on each node for storing data, code, and running processes. \n* **Network:**  The script likely uses the network for communication between nodes, if multiple nodes are involved in the job.\n\nThe application executed by the script is likely a machine learning or deep learning task, potentially for image training, as the `image_train.py` script is referenced. \n"
