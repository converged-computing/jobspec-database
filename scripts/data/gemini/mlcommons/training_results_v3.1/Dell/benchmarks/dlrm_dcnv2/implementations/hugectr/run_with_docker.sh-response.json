This is evident from the script's name, environment variables, and commands. \n* **Software:** \n    * **Docker:** The script uses Docker to run the DLRM application in a containerized environment.\n    * **HugeCTR:** The script specifically mentions using HugeCTR, indicating it's a framework used for training DLRM.\n    * **Python:** The script uses Python commands for tasks like logging, cache clearing, and compliance checks.\n    * **mlperf_logging:**  This library appears to be used for logging performance metrics and compliance checks, as seen in the script.\n* **Resources:**\n    * **GPU:**  The script uses `--gpus all`, indicating it requires a GPU for training DLRM.\n    * **Docker:**  The script uses Docker, which requires Docker Engine to be installed and running.\n    * **Bash:** The script is written in Bash, which requires a Bash interpreter.\n    * **Network:** The script uses `--net=host`, implying it requires access to the host's network.\n    * **Storage:** The script interacts with directories and files, requiring storage space on the system. \n\n**Key Points about the Script:**\n\n* **DLRM Training:** The script orchestrates the training of a DLRM model using HugeCTR, leveraging a Docker container for resource management.\n* **Logging and Compliance:** It integrates mlperf_logging for performance metrics and compliance checking against the MLPerf ruleset.\n* **Containerization:** The script uses Docker to create a consistent and isolated environment for the DLRM training process.\n* **Resource Management:**  It carefully manages resources like GPUs and storage, demonstrating best practices for large-scale deep learning applications. \n"
