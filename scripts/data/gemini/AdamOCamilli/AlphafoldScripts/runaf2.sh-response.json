It leverages a variety of software and resources. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Software:**\n\n* **sbatch:**  A job scheduler used on the Tufts HPC cluster to submit batch jobs to run on the cluster's resources.\n* **Python3:**  The core language used to execute AlphaFold's code.\n* **conda:** A package and environment management system used to install and manage dependencies.\n* **nvidia-smi:** A utility to monitor and manage NVIDIA GPUs.\n* **cuda:** NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit, essential for running GPU-accelerated code.\n* **cudnn:** CUDA Deep Neural Network library,  optimizing deep learning operations on GPUs.\n* **anaconda:** A distribution of Python and R programming languages, often used to simplify the installation of packages and environments.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **GPU:**  The script explicitly requests a single GPU (likely a v100 or a100) to accelerate the computationally demanding AlphaFold calculations.\n* **CPU:** The script uses eight CPU cores for processing (specified by `#SBATCH -n 8`).\n* **RAM:** The script reserves 64GB of RAM for the job (specified by `#SBATCH --mem=64g`).\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. The script defines a function (`run_sbatch`) that creates a batch script for submission to the HPC cluster.\n2. This script sets up the environment by loading necessary modules (CUDA, cudnn, and Anaconda) and activating the \"af2\" conda environment, presumably containing AlphaFold.\n3. The script then calls the `run_af2.py` script, which likely contains the core logic for executing AlphaFold.\n4. This script allows you to pass in a directory or individual FASTA files, each representing a protein sequence.\n5. For each protein sequence, the script submits a separate batch job to the HPC cluster, using the specified resources and output locations.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* The script is specifically designed to run on the Tufts HPC cluster. \n* It relies on the `sbatch` command and associated configuration for managing resource allocation. \n* The script includes a helpful usage message and default directory creation for organizing output and error logs. \n"
