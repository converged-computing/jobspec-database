It leverages the following:\n\n* **SLURM:**  A workload manager that manages the allocation of resources and execution of jobs on a cluster.\n* **Horovod:**  A distributed training framework that allows for training large models across multiple GPUs and nodes.\n* **Python:** The scripting language used to implement the training logic.\n* **Conda:** A package manager used to create and manage virtual environments, ensuring the correct dependencies are installed for the training process.\n* **BigGAN-PyTorch:** A specific PyTorch implementation of the BigGAN architecture, used for training a generative adversarial network (GAN). \n* **WandB:** A tool for logging and tracking training metrics, visualizing progress, and managing experiments. \n\nThe script also utilizes various cluster resources: \n\n* **GPU (V100):**  High-performance graphics processing units specifically designed for deep learning tasks, which are crucial for efficient training.\n* **CPU:** The central processing unit handles the general execution logic of the script and manages data processing. \n* **Memory (500GB):**  Required for storing the model parameters, datasets, and intermediate calculations. \n* **Network:**  To facilitate communication between the different nodes involved in distributed training using Horovod.\n* **Storage (nobackup):**  Where the training data, code, and results are stored. \n"
