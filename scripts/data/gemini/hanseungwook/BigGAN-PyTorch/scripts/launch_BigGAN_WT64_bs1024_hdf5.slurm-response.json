It utilizes **PyTorch** as the deep learning library, leveraging **NCCL** for communication between GPUs. It also uses **WandB** for experiment tracking.\n\nThe script is configured to run on a single node with two GPUs per node. It requires 500GB of memory and a maximum runtime of 24 hours. It uses the `sched_system_all` queue for scheduling. The script utilizes a **Conda** environment named `neurips` for managing dependencies. While the specific Python version is not explicitly stated, it is likely Python 3 due to the use of PyTorch. \n\nThe script includes various parameters for the training process, such as dataset path, batch size, learning rate, and optimizer settings. It also incorporates features like checkpointing, logging, and early stopping. \n"
