    "application": "GROMACS",
    "details": "The script runs a series of GROMACS simulations, using the MPI implementation. It utilizes 48 cores per node and requires 8GB of memory. The script runs for a maximum of 24 hours. The script first runs a NVT simulation followed by an NPT simulation and then a 50ns MD simulation. The script utilizes the 'module load' command to load the GROMACS module with specific versions of OpenMPI and Intel compilers."
