SSH is likely used for transferring data or files related to the training process.\n    - **Database:** The script uses a database (likely PostgreSQL) to store data and manage the distributed training process.\n\nThe script uses several PBS directives to control the execution of the job, and it sets up environment variables to configure the different Python scripts responsible for running the database, the master process, and the workers for the distributed training. \n"
