    "application": "ncu",
    "details": "The script uses the NVIDIA Nsight Compute (ncu) profiler for performance analysis of an executable named 'a.out'. It runs on a single node with a GPU (specified by '-C gpu' and '-G 1'), using the 'regular' queue for a maximum of 10 minutes ('-t 00:10:00'). It also specifies an account ('-A m3930'), a job name ('-J queue' and '--job-name=gpu-job'), and output/error files ('--output=gpu-job.o%j' and '--error=gpu-job.e%j'). The script expects the user to have a properly configured environment for Cori GPUs and to provide the number of threads per thread block and the number of thread blocks as arguments to the 'a.out' executable. Finally, it uses ncu to monitor specific metrics: 'smsp__cycles_active.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed', 'dram__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed', and 'gpu__time_duration.avg'."
