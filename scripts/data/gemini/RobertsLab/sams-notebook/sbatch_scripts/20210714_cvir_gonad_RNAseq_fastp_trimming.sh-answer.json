    "script_description": "This script is designed to perform quality trimming on RNA-seq data using the Fastp software. It uses Slurm to manage the job execution and utilize available compute resources. The script takes raw FastQ files as input, trims them using Fastp, generates checksums for trimmed files, and uses MultiQC to generate a summary report of the quality control process.  It also logs program options and system PATH information."
