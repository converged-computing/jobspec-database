It leverages the `torchrun` utility to distribute the training process across multiple processes. The script requires a GPU (specifically 6000MiB of GPU memory) and specifies the use of the `c10d` rendezvous backend for communication between the processes. It also utilizes the `nvidia-smi` command to display information about the GPU. The script trains a baseline model using different configurations (e.g., model type, dataset, hyperparameters), but the primary focus is on a BART model trained on the CNNDM dataset. The script is designed to run on a single node with a specified number of processes per node. It uses a random port for communication and defines various parameters related to the training process, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. The script is executed within a SLURM environment, as indicated by the `#SBATCH` directives, which manage job submission and resource allocation.\"\n}\n```"
