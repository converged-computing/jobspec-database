    "details": "The script is a collection of test functions designed for use with the OpenHPC software suite. It includes functions for checking RPM packages, resource managers, executables, compiler families, and MPI toolchains. It also provides functions for running serial and MPI binaries through a resource manager (e.g., Slurm or PBS). The script utilizes environment variables like LMOD_FAMILY_COMPILER, LMOD_FAMILY_MPI, RESOURCE_MANAGER, and DISTRO_FAMILY to determine the appropriate configurations. It uses functions like check_if_rpm_installed, check_rms, check_exe, check_compiler_family, run_serial_binary, and run_mpi_binary for testing and execution purposes. It also leverages external commands like rpm, srun, qsub, and scalasca. The script includes features like saving logs in directory structures and supporting different compilers, MPI implementations, and resource managers."
