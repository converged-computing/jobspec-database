The exact size of the workspace is not explicitly mentioned in the script. \n* **Environment:** The script uses a Python virtual environment, which is activated at the beginning and deactivated at the end. This ensures that the correct versions of Python packages required by the pipeline are used. \n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based on the provided script.  The exact software and resource requirements of the actual pipeline (pipeline.nf) are not known and might be more extensive. \n"
