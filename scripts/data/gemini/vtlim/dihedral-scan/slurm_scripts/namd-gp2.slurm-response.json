Here is a breakdown of the script's functionality and the software/resource requirements:\n\n**Functionality:**\n\n1. **Job Submission and Setup:** \n   - Uses `sbatch` directives to define job parameters such as name, dependencies, account, partition, and resource requirements.\n   - Sets up environment variables related to SLURM, like `SLURM_NTASKS`, `SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES`, and `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK`.\n   - Defines a function `slurm_startjob()` to encapsulate the actual simulation execution.\n   - Defines a function `slurm_info_out()` to print informational output about the job.\n\n2. **Local Work Directory (Optional):**\n   - Allows the user to specify a `copy_local` flag to copy the contents of the submission directory to a node-local workspace. \n   - If `copy_local` is \"yes\", the script creates a temporary directory (`/work/$USER/$SLURM_JOB_ID`) on the node, copies the files, and performs the simulation in this workspace. \n   - After the simulation, it copies the results back to the submission directory and removes the temporary directory.\n\n3. **Simulation Execution:**\n   - The `slurm_startjob()` function:\n     - Loads the required software modules using `ml purge` and `ml` commands.\n     - Executes the NAMD simulation using `srun` with specific options for MPI and CPU binding.\n     - Prints a message indicating the job completion and the current date.\n\n4. **Post-Execution:**\n   - If `copy_local` is \"yes\", the script copies data back to the submission directory and removes the temporary work directory.\n\n**Software Requirements:**\n\n- **SLURM:** The script heavily relies on SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) for job submission, resource allocation, and management. \n- **NAMD:** The primary application used for the simulation.\n- **OpenMPI:**  Required for running NAMD as a parallel application.\n- **Intel Compilers:** The script loads a specific version of Intel compilers (2018.3) for compiling the NAMD code (which is probably compiled with Intel compilers). \n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n- **Nodes:**  1 (although the script can be modified to use multiple nodes, as seen in the commented out lines).\n- **CPUs per Task:** 1 (although the script can be modified to use more CPUs per task, as seen in the commented out lines).\n- **Time:** 1 hour (1-0, with 1 hour and 0 minutes).\n- **Memory:** Not explicitly specified in the script.  However, the commented out line `#SBATCH --mem=8gb` suggests the job might need at least 8 GB of memory.\n\n**Other Notes:**\n\n- The `#SBATCH` directives in the script are used to specify options for SLURM.\n- The `srun` command is used to launch the NAMD simulation with multiple processes across the allocated nodes.\n- The `ml` commands are used to load software modules on the HPC system, making sure the appropriate versions of NAMD and OpenMPI are available.\n\nThis script is a template for running NAMD simulations on a SLURM-based HPC system. You will likely need to modify specific parameters like the NAMD input file, the number of nodes, and the runtime according to your simulation requirements. \n"
