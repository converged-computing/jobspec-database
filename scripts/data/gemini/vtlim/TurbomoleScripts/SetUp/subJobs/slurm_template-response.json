The script utilizes various SLURM directives to specify job resources, including the number of nodes, tasks per node, CPUs per task, memory per CPU, and the time limit for the job. The script also includes options for defining the job name, account (optional), and partition (required). \n\nThe script also includes options for copying the submission directory's contents to a node-local workspace and then copying back the results after the calculation is complete. This feature ensures that the user has access to all the necessary files and output after the job has finished. The script also includes a basic error handling mechanism to monitor the success of the copy process and log any errors encountered.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the script's sections:\n\n* **Header:** Defines the script as a bash script and provides information about its purpose.\n* **SLURM directives:** Specifies the resources required for the job, including the job name, account, partition, number of nodes, tasks per node, CPUs per task, memory per CPU, and time limit.\n* **Resource specification:** Explains the available partitions on the cluster, their CPU types, cores per node, and speeds.\n* **Local environment variables:** Defines some local environment variables for easier access to SLURM variables.\n* **slurm_startjob function:** This is where the actual Turbomole command is executed. This section needs to be customized based on the specific Turbomole calculation.\n* **SLURM environment variables:**  Provides a list of relevant SLURM environment variables and their descriptions.\n* **slurm_info_out function:** Displays information about the SLURM job, including the job ID, name, partition, nodes, and submission host.\n* **File copy and execution:**  The script checks if the `copy_local` variable is set to \"yes\". If it is, it copies the contents of the submission directory to a node-local workspace, executes the `slurm_startjob` function, and then copies the results back to the submission directory.  \n\nThis script provides a robust framework for running Turbomole jobs on a SLURM cluster. The specific Turbomole command to execute within the `slurm_startjob` function needs to be replaced based on the user's specific needs.\n"
