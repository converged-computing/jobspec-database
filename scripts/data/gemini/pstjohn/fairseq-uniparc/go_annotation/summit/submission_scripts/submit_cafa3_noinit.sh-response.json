The specific model is a RoBERTa-based sentence labeling model trained for GO annotation using a SwissProt dataset.\n\nThe script leverages LSF for job scheduling and resource allocation. It employs IBM Watson Machine Learning Community Edition for managing software environments and dependencies, particularly using conda for activating a dedicated fairseq environment.\n\nThe script also utilizes jsrun, a tool for running distributed jobs, to leverage multiple nodes and CPUs for parallel processing. Each node is configured to use 42 cores, and a total of 6 GPUs are allocated for the task. \n\nThe script uses a distributed file system (GPFS) for accessing the dataset and saving checkpoints. \n\nThe script relies on several libraries and packages, including Python, CUDA, and NCCL for distributed training. \n\nThe script uses the following resources:\n* **Computational Resources:** 42 CPU cores per node and 6 GPUs.\n* **Storage:** NVME storage for efficient data access and a distributed file system (GPFS) for data storage.\n* **Network:** A dedicated port (23456) for distributed communication.\n\nFinally, the script utilizes TensorBoard for visualization and monitoring of the training process. \n"
