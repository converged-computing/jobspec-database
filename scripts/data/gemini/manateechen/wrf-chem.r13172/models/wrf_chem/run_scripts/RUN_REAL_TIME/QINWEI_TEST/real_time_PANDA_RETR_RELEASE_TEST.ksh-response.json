It requires:\\n\\n1)  The WRF-Chem/DART code, which is expected to be in a directory called TRUNK_DIR.  The script assumes specific subdirectory structures within this directory for the WRF-Chem, WPS, WRFDA, and DART code.  The versions of each code are defined by the variables WPS_VER, WPS_GEOG_VER, WRFDA_VER, WRF_VER, WRFCHEM_VER, and DART_VER.\\n\\n2)  Static data, such as land use and vegetation parameters.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_STATIC_FILES.\\n\\n3)  Emissions data from a variety of sources, including anthropogenic, fire, and biogenic emissions.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_WRFCHEMI_DIR, EXPERIMENT_WRFFIRECHEMI_DIR, and EXPERIMENT_WRFBIOCHEMI_DIR, respectively.\\n\\n4)  Data from global forecasts (e.g., GFS).  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_GFS_DIR.\\n\\n5)  Meteorological observational data, including surface observations (e.g., SYNOP, METAR) and upper-air observations (e.g., radiosondes).  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_PREPBUFR_DIR\\n\\n6)  Trace gas observations from MOPITT and IASI instruments.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_MOPITT_CO_DIR and EXPERIMENT_IASI_CO_DIR, respectively.\\n\\n7)  Ozone observations from IASI.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_IASI_O3_DIR.\\n\\n8)  Ozone and carbon monoxide observations from AIRNOW.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_AIRNOW_DIR.\\n\\n9)  Carbon monoxide, ozone, and PM2.5 observations from PANDA.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_PANDA_DIR.\\n\\n10) Aerosol optical depth observations from MODIS.  These data are expected to be in EXPERIMENT_MODIS_AOD_DIR.\"\n}\n```"
