It utilizes various tools and resources:\n\n* **GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit):** This is the core tool used for realignment and recalibration. The script requires the GATK directory to be specified in the runfile.\n* **samtools:** Used for manipulating BAM files, likely for sorting or indexing.\n* **picard:** A collection of utilities for processing genomic data, including BAM file manipulation and quality control.\n* **tabix:** A tool for indexing genomic data files, allowing for efficient retrieval of specific regions.\n* **vcftools:** A suite of utilities for working with variant call format (VCF) files.\n* **Anisimov:** A job scheduling and resource allocation system, used to manage the execution of realignment and recalibration tasks across multiple nodes.\n* **PBS (Portable Batch System):** The script utilizes PBS for job submission and resource allocation. Specific resource requirements, such as CPU time and memory, are defined in the runfile. \n* **Runfile:**  This file contains configuration settings for the pipeline, including paths to tools, reference genomes, and specific parameters for different analysis types.\n* **Sample information file:**  This file lists samples and their corresponding BAM files.\n* **Reference genome:** The script requires a reference genome for alignment and variant calling.\n* **Indel directory:** Contains indel information used for realignment and recalibration.\n* **Java module:** The script needs a specific Java module for GATK execution.\n\n**Script Functionality:**\n\n1. **Parsing Configuration:**  The script reads the runfile and extracts essential parameters, including paths to tools, reference genome, indel information, and resource requirements.\n2. **Sanity Checks:** It performs checks to ensure the existence and validity of input files, output directories, and configured resources.\n3. **Generating Regions and Intervals:**  Based on the chromosome index and the reference genome, the script defines regions and intervals for realignment and recalibration.\n4. **Creating Output Folders:**  It creates directories for each sample's analysis, ensuring logs and results are organized.\n5. **Forming RG (Read Group) Lines:**  Read group lines are created based on the header information of BAM files for each sample.\n6. **Nested Loops:** The script uses two nested loops:\n    * **Outer loop (by chromosome):**  Processes each chromosome independently.\n    * **Inner loop (by sample):**  Processes each sample, generating commands for realignment and recalibration for the current chromosome.\n7. **Generating Anisimov Joblists:** For each chromosome, it creates a joblist file containing commands for each sample's realignment and recalibration.\n8. **Qsub Submission:** The script submits Qsub jobs for each chromosome to the PBS system, using the generated joblists and resource requirements.\n9. **Anisimov Launcher:**  The Qsub jobs execute Anisimov's scheduler to distribute tasks across multiple nodes for parallel processing.\n\nThis script demonstrates a complex variant calling workflow that relies on several tools, resources, and careful parameter management to achieve accurate and efficient analysis. \n"
