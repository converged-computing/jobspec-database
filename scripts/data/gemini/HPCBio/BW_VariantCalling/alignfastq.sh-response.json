Here's a breakdown of its functionality and requirements:\n\n**Workflow:**\n\n1. **Parameter Check:** The script first checks for the correct number of input parameters (5) and verifies the existence of the run configuration file.\n2. **Parsing Run Information:** The script parses the run configuration file, extracting critical settings for the alignment process. These settings include:\n    - Input Type: \"WGS\" (Whole Genome Sequencing) or \"WES\" (Whole Exome Sequencing)\n    - Reference Genome: Directory and filename\n    - Aligner: \"Novoalign\", \"BWA_ALN\", or \"BWA_MEM\"\n    - Mark Duplicates: \"YES\" or \"NO\" \n    - Chunk FastQ: \"YES\" or \"NO\" (whether to split large FASTQ files into chunks for parallel processing)\n    - Output Directory: Where to store results\n    - PBS Settings: Node count, walltime, queue, and project ID\n    - FastQC settings: Enable/disable FastQC and parameters\n3. **Input File Validation:** The script checks for the existence of the sample name list (`SAMPLENAMES_multiplexed.list`) and the input FASTQ files.\n4. **Directory Structure:** It creates output directories for logs, alignment results, and FastQC reports.\n5. **Alignment Loop:** The script loops through each sample in the sample name list:\n    - **FastQC:** If enabled, FastQC is run on the input FASTQ files.\n    - **Chunking:** If `CHUNKFASTQ` is set to \"YES,\" the FASTQ files are split into chunks.\n    - **Alignment:** The selected aligner (Novoalign, BWA_ALN, or BWA_MEM) is used to align the reads to the reference genome.\n    - **Merging:** If chunking was used, the aligned chunks are merged into a single alignment file.\n    - **Sorting:** The alignment file is sorted.\n    - **Marking Duplicates:** If `MARKDUP` is set to \"YES,\" duplicate reads are marked.\n6. **Job Scheduling:** The script schedules the alignment jobs using either a parallel launcher (like \"aprun\" or \"mpirun\") or a PBS queueing system.  The specific method is determined by the `RUNMETHOD` setting in the run configuration file.\n\n**Software Requirements:**\n\n- **Aligner:** One of the following:\n    - Novoalign: Requires the `NOVODIR` and `NOVOINDEX` settings in the configuration file.\n    - BWA_ALN: Requires the `BWAALNDIR` and `BWAALNINDEX` settings in the configuration file.\n    - BWA_MEM: Requires the `BWAMEMDIR` and `BWAMEMINDEX` settings in the configuration file.\n- **Sortool:**  One of the following:\n    - NOVOSORT: Used for merging and sorting aligned reads when chunking is enabled.\n    - PICARD: Used for merging and sorting aligned reads when chunking is enabled. \n- **Markduplicatestool:** One of the following:\n    - PICARD: Used for marking duplicate reads.\n    - SAMBLASTER: Used for marking duplicate reads.\n- **Profiler:** Specified by the `PROFILER` setting in the configuration file.\n- **FastQC:** Used for quality control analysis of the input FASTQ files if enabled.\n- **Launcher:** The `scheduler.x` script is used for parallel job execution when `RUNMETHOD` is set to \"LAUNCHER.\"\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n- **Nodes:**  The number of nodes needed for the alignment process is determined by the `PBSNODES` setting. \n- **Threads:** The number of threads to use per node is specified by the `PBSTHREADS` setting.\n- **Walltime:** The maximum walltime allowed for the alignment jobs is specified by the `PBSCPUALIGNWGEN` setting (for WGS) or `PBSCPUALIGNEXOME` setting (for WES) in the configuration file.\n- **Queue:** The PBS queue to submit jobs to is specified by the `PBSQUEUEWGEN` setting (for WGS) or `PBSQUEUEEXOME` setting (for WES) in the configuration file.\n- **Project:** The PBS project ID is specified by the `PBSPROJECTID` setting. \n\n**Output:**\n\n- **Alignment Results:** Aligned BAM files are stored in the `align` subdirectory of the output directory.\n- **FastQC Reports:** If enabled, FastQC reports are stored in the `fastqc` subdirectory of the output directory.\n- **Logs:** Logs for each step of the process are stored in the `logs` subdirectory of the output directory. \n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis script provides a comprehensive workflow for aligning FASTQ sequencing reads, incorporating options for parallelism, quality control, and duplicate marking. The script utilizes PBS for job scheduling and can utilize either a parallel launcher or direct PBS submissions depending on the user's configuration. \n"
