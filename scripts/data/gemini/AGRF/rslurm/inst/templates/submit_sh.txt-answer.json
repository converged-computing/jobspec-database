    "details": "This script is designed to run R scripts within the SLURM workload manager. It leverages Singularity containers for R environments, and includes features such as:\n\n* **Array job submission:** The script utilizes SLURM's array job functionality to submit multiple tasks within a single job. The `--array` option specifies the range of tasks (from 0 to `{{{max_node}}}`).\n* **Job name:** The `--job-name` option defines a descriptive name for the job, set as `{{{jobname}}}`, facilitating easier identification within the SLURM system.\n* **Output redirection:**  The `--output` option redirects standard output for each task to a file named `slurm_%a.out` within the specified `{{{tmp_dir}}}` directory within the `{{{project_dir}}}`.\n* **Custom flags and options:** The script allows for inclusion of additional SLURM flags (`--{{{name}}}`) and options (`--{{{name}}}={{{value}}}`) to configure the job based on specific requirements.\n* **Working directory:** The `--chdir` option sets the working directory for the job to `{{{project_dir}}}`, ensuring the script executes in the correct context.\n* **Singularity container loading:** The script uses the `module load` command to load a Singularity R module, specifically `simg_R/{{{r_version}}}`, making the R environment accessible within the container.\n* **Environment variable export:** The script exports the `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` environment variable to Singularity, ensuring the task ID is available within the container environment.\n* **R script execution:** Finally, the script executes the R script located at `{{{tmp_dir}}}/slurm_run.R` using the `Rscript` command."
