This is indicated by the `#BSUB` directives at the beginning of the script.\n* **Software:** The script uses the following software:\n    * **spectrum-mpi/10.4.0.3-20210112:** A high-performance MPI implementation for parallel computing.\n    * **gcc/10.2.0:** A C and C++ compiler.\n    * **adios2/2.7.1:** A parallel I/O library.\n    * **jsrun:** A command-line tool for launching and managing parallel jobs on LSF clusters.\n    * **rm:** A command for removing files and directories.\n* **Resources:** The script requests and utilizes several resources, including:\n    * **Nodes:** Number of compute nodes for the job (specified by `-nnodes 1`).\n    * **Processes:** Number of processes to launch (specified by `--nrs ${processes}`).\n    * **CPU:** Number of CPU cores per process (specified by `--cpu_per_rs 1`).\n    * **GPU:** Number of GPUs per process (specified by `--gpu_per_rs 0`).\n    * **Memory:**  The script does not explicitly specify memory requirements, but LSF will allocate memory based on the job's needs.\n    * **Network:** The script uses the `-EFABRIC_IFACE` and other network-related variables to configure the network communication.  \n\n**Key points:**\n\n* The script utilizes LSF for job scheduling and resource allocation.\n* It uses `module load` to load the required software modules.\n* `jsrun` is used to launch the parallel job.\n* The script utilizes RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) for high-performance communication.\n* The script executes two scenarios: one with SST (Scalable Synchronous Transport) and another with BP4 (Basic Parallel 4) transport protocols.\n* The script cleans up files (`.bp`, `.sst`) after each execution.\n\nThe script is designed to run a parallel application on an LSF cluster, utilizing specific software modules and network settings. It demonstrates how to launch and manage parallel jobs, leverage RDMA for fast communication, and switch between different transport protocols for data transfer. \n"
