    "application": "Slurm",
    "details": "The script utilizes the Slurm workload manager for resource allocation and job submission. It requests 32 compute nodes with a 2-hour runtime limit. The script also specifies a particular resource requirement: \"span[ptile=16]\", which suggests a specific configuration for memory or processor affinity. The script includes commands to clean up temporary files, concatenate files, and execute other scripts, specifically 'ride_modules_cuda.sh' and 'nightly_cron_script_trilinos_ride.sh', which appear to be related to the Trilinos software and may involve CUDA-enabled components. The script also utilizes 'ctest_nightly.cmake' for testing purposes."
