    "details": "The script is a workflow for running the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and generating perturbed initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) using the WRFDA (WRF Data Assimilation) system. It prepares the run directory by linking all necessary files, including real.exe (for generating the forecast), da_wrfvar.exe (for perturbing the ICs and BCs), dart_to_wrf, wrf_to_dart, pert_wrf_bc, da_advance_time.exe, be.dat, and met_em* files. The script also uses the ncks utility from the NCO distribution for extracting specific data from the output files. The script requires specific software and resources:\n\n1. **WRF and WRFDA:** The script expects the WRF and WRFDA model executables (real.exe, da_wrfvar.exe, ndown.exe) to be available in the defined directory paths.  \n2. **DART:** The script uses several utilities from the DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) system, including dart_to_wrf, wrf_to_dart, pert_wrf_bc, and da_advance_time.exe. These utilities should be located in the DART/models/wrf/work directory.\n3. **NCO:** The script uses the ncks utility, part of the NCO (NetCDF Operators) distribution, for manipulating NetCDF files. \n4. **MPI:**  The script has provisions for running MPI-enabled da_wrfvar.exe. If running an MPI version of the software, appropriate commands for launching the MPI job are needed. \n5. **Background Error Covariance File:** The script expects a background error covariance file (be.dat) to be present in the ICBC directory. \n6. **WPS output:** The script uses output files from WPS (WRF Preprocessing System) (met_em* files) to initialize the WRF model. \n7. **Other dependencies:** The script relies on tools like m4,  awk, and other utilities commonly available in Unix-like environments."
