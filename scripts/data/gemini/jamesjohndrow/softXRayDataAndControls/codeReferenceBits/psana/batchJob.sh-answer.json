    "details": "The script utilizes LSF (Load Sharing Facility) for job submission. It checks if the user is logged into a 'psana' node and then submits a job using the 'bsub' command. The script also specifies the output log file location, the queue ('psanaq'), the number of nodes ('-n 32'), and the command to execute: 'mpirun --mca btl ^openib python fastHD5.py $1'. The script also uses the 'mpirun' command to run the Python script 'fastHD5.py' with the argument '$1', likely a data file. The script also sets the 'btl' (Byte Transfer Layer) to 'openib' for improved performance using the InfiniBand network."
