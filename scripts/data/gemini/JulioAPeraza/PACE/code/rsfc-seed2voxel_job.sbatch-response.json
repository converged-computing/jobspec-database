Singularity is a containerization platform that allows users to package applications and dependencies into a single container image, which can then be run on different computing environments.\n* **Software:**\n    * **Singularity:** It is the primary execution environment and handles the creation and execution of the container.\n    * **afni:** This software is used for the denoising pipeline.\n    * **Python:** The `rsfc-seed2voxel.py` script uses Python for its logic and functionality.\n* **Resources:**\n    * **SLURM:** The script leverages the **Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)** to manage resources for the analysis. This allows for job scheduling, resource allocation, and monitoring.\n    * **GPFS:** The script assumes access to **GPFS (General Parallel File System)**, a parallel file system used for data storage. \n    * **CPU:** The script uses `--cpus-per-task=4`, indicating that it requires 4 CPU cores per task. \n    * **Memory:** The script uses `--mem-per-cpu=4gb`, meaning that it requires 4 GB of memory per CPU core.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of the script:**\n\nThe script is designed to run a resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis pipeline using a Singularity container. The script utilizes several features of SLURM, such as `--job-name`, `--time`, `--nodes`, `--ntasks`, `--cpus-per-task`, `--mem-per-cpu`, `--partition`, `--output`, and `--error`. These options allow for the management and tracking of the analysis job. \n\nThe script uses environment variables like `DATA`, `HOST_DIR`, `PROJECT`, `DSETS_DIR`, `BIDS_DIR`, `CODE_DIR`, `IMG_DIR`, `DERIVS_DIR`, and `ROIs_DIR` to define paths for different directories and files. The script also sets variables for versions of specific software like `mriqc_ver`, `fmriprep_ver`, and `afni_ver`.\n\nThe script iterates through different seed regions and hemispheres, running the RSFC pipeline for each. The `rsfc-seed2voxel.py` script is called using the `singularity exec` command, which executes the script within the Singularity container environment. The script also passes multiple arguments to the Python script, including the paths for different directories, the subject ID, the space, the description lists, the clusters (regions of interest), and the number of jobs to use. \n\nFinally, the script logs the results of the analysis to a table, including the subject ID, the task ID, and the exit code. The script also prints a message to the console indicating the completion of the task and the exit code. \n"
