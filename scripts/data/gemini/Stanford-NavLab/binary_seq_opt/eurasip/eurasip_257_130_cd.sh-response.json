It loads them using the `module load` command.\n* **SLURM** is configured with various resources:\n    * **time:**  Maximum runtime of the job is 48 hours.\n    * **nodes:** 1 node is allocated for the job.\n    * **tasks_per_node:**  The job will use 1 task per node.\n    * **cores:** The job will use 4 cores per node.\n    * **memory:**  8GB of memory is allocated.\n    * **partition:** The job will run on the \"normal\" partition of the SLURM cluster.\n* Several **environment variables** are set, including:\n    * **SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR:**  This variable defines the directory where the script was submitted from.\n    * **GUROBI_HOME:** This variable defines the path to the Gurobi installation.\n* **Julia** is called with the `--heap-size-hint=4G` flag, indicating a hint to allocate 4GB of memory to the Julia process.\n\n**Note:** \n* The `lscpu` command is used to display information about the CPU architecture of the node, which is not directly related to the application. \n* There's a commented-out line setting the `MOSEKBINDIR` variable, suggesting that the script could be configured to use the Mosek solver as well, but it's not currently being used. \n* The final command line `julia ... eurasip.jl ...` executes the Julia script \"eurasip.jl\" with a set of parameters, which are specific to the problem being solved by the script. \n"
