    "application": "Singularity",
    "details": "The script uses Singularity to run various Docker images. It includes images from different sources like Quay.io, Rocker, Jupyter, Library, NVCR, and Docker Hub. These images contain software like Blast, Tidyverse, Jupyter Notebook, OpenFOAM, Gromacs, Trinity RNAseq, Nextflow, and GNUplot. The script also requires access to a Singularity installation and a cluster environment with SLURM for job scheduling. It utilizes the SLURM directives for job name, number of tasks, and execution time. Additionally, the script demonstrates the usage of the 'echo ciao' command, which is a placeholder for actual commands to be executed within the Docker images."
