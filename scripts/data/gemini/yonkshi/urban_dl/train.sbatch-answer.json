    "application": "SLURM",
    "details": "The script uses SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) for job submission and resource management. It requests 10GB of memory, one GPU, four CPU cores per task, and restricts the job to run on specific nodes: khazadum, rivendell, belegost, or shire. The script also defines email notifications and logs to specific directories. Additionally, it activates two conda environments: 'project_env' for running 'train.py' and 'gpu2' for running 'train_xview2.py'. Finally, the script uses 'nvidia-smi' to display GPU information."
