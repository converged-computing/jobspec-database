It uses PBS commands to request resources (nodes, MPI tasks, walltime, etc.) and manage the job execution.\",\n    \"GROMACS\": \"The primary application is GROMACS, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package. The script utilizes GROMACS commands to perform molecular dynamics calculations and post-processing analysis.\",\n    \"OpenMP\": \"The script has the option to use OpenMP for parallel processing. OpenMP allows for parallelization within a single node by utilizing multiple threads.\",\n    \"MPI\": \"The script also supports MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing. MPI enables parallelization across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for simulations of larger systems.\",\n    \"curl\": \"The script uses curl to send a notification to a Telegram bot after the simulation completes. Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols, including HTTP.\",\n    \"ssh\": \"The script uses SSH (Secure Shell) to remotely connect to the login node and send the Telegram notification. SSH provides secure communication over an insecure network.\"\n  }\n}\n```"
