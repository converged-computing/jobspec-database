        "PBS": "The script is a PBS (Portable Batch System) script designed to run on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. It uses PBS commands to request resources (nodes, MPI tasks, walltime, etc.) and manage the job execution.",
        "GROMACS": "The primary application is GROMACS, a popular molecular dynamics simulation package. The script utilizes GROMACS commands to perform molecular dynamics calculations and post-processing analysis.",
        "OpenMP": "The script has the option to use OpenMP for parallel processing. OpenMP allows for parallelization within a single node by utilizing multiple threads.",
        "MPI": "The script also supports MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing. MPI enables parallelization across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for simulations of larger systems.",
        "curl": "The script uses curl to send a notification to a Telegram bot after the simulation completes. Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols, including HTTP.",
        "ssh": "The script uses SSH (Secure Shell) to remotely connect to the login node and send the Telegram notification. SSH provides secure communication over an insecure network."
