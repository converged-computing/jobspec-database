It takes the input data, output directory, project name, trim positions, maximum expected error, minimum overlap reads, and optional pooling method as arguments. The script also provides examples for running multiple runs and merging the results.",
    "script_output": "The script generates a .pdf file in the output directory depicting the error model and produces ASV tables for each sample."
