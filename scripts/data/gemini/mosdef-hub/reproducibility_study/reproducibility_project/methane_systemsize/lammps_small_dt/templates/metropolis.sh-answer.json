    "details": "The script is designed to run a job on a SLURM cluster. It uses the following resources and software:\n\n* **SLURM:** The script utilizes SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) for job scheduling and resource allocation. It defines various SLURM parameters including:\n    * **job-name:** The name of the job (set to the `id` variable). \n    * **-t:**  The maximum run time of the job (199 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds). \n    * **--ntasks:** The number of tasks requested (1). \n    * **--mem:** The amount of memory requested (1GB). \n    * **--partition:**  The partition to submit the job to (optional, specified by the `partition` variable). \n    * **--nodelist:** The specific nodes to run the job on (optional, specified by the `nodelist` variable). \n    * **--output:** The output file location (in `workspace/{{operations[0]._jobs[0]}}/job_%j.o`). \n    * **--error:** The error file location (in `workspace/{{operations[0]._jobs[0]}}/job_%j.e`).\n\n* **Anaconda:** The script loads the Anaconda environment using the `module load anaconda` command.  It also activates a specific environment named `mosdef-study38` using `source activate mosdef-study38`.\n\n* **Bash Scripting:** The script is written in Bash and leverages templating functionality to dynamically set values like job name, output/error file locations, and potentially other parameters based on variables defined in the script or its parent template. \n\n* **Other:** The script uses standard Unix commands like `date` to record the execution timestamp in a file called `execution.log`."
