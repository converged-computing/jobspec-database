    "application": "Slurm",
    "details": "The script is written for Slurm workload manager and uses a variety of resources and software depending on the value of the 'operations' variable.\n\n* **GPU usage:**  If 'operations' has directives with 'ngpu' values, the script requests a GPU queue, a number of GPUs based on the sum of 'ngpu' values, and the constraint 'v100'. It also loads CUDA 11.0.\n\n* **CPU usage:** If 'operations' does not have 'ngpu' values, the script requests the 'primary' queue, the constraint 'intel', and does not load CUDA.\n\n* **Software:** The script sources the user's bash configuration (~/.bashrc), activates the 'mosdef-study38' conda environment, loads Python 3.8, and switches from GNU 7 to Intel 2019 compiler.\n\n* **Output:** The script outputs to files named 'output-%j.dat' and 'error-%j.dat', where %j is the Slurm job ID.\n\n* **Other:** The script prints the hostname and current date."
