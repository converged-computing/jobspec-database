    "details": "This script runs integration tests on the GEOS-Chem Classic model. It takes a root folder, environment file, and optionally, a scheduler, partition, and quick flag. It creates run directories, edits HEMCO_Config.rc files, compiles the code, and executes integration tests. It supports SLURM and LSF schedulers, and also allows interactive running of the tests. The script relies on commonFunctionsForTests.sh for utility functions."
