    "details": "This script runs integration tests for the GEOS-Chem Global Chemical Transport Model. It supports running tests interactively or with a scheduler (SLURM or LSF). The script takes several command-line arguments: \n\n -d root-dir: Specifies the root directory for integration tests. \n -e env-file: Specifies the environment file containing module loads. \n -h: Displays a help message. \n -n: Disables bootstrapping of missing restart file variables. \n -p partition: Selects the partition for SLURM or LSF schedulers. \n -q: Runs a quick set of integration tests for testing purposes. \n -s scheduler: Specifies the scheduler (SLURM or LSF). \n\n The script also utilizes a set of utility functions defined in commonFunctionsForTests.sh for setting up configuration files and performing other tasks. \n\n The script creates integration test directories in the root folder, edits the setCommonRunSettings.sh scripts to enable or disable bootstrapping, and then runs the compilation and execution tests based on the selected scheduler. It also includes options for submitting jobs as dependencies and printing job IDs for tracking."
