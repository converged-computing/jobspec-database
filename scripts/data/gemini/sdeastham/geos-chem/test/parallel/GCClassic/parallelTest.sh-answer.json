    "details": "The script runs parallelization tests for the GEOS-Chem Classic model. It uses either the SLURM or LSF scheduler to submit jobs for compiling and executing the model, or runs them interactively. The script requires a root directory for the tests, an environment file specifying module loads, and a partition name if using SLURM or LSF.  It supports quick tests for faster testing. The script utilizes utility functions from \"commonFunctionsForTests.sh\" to set up configuration files and manage directories. "
