    "details": "The script is designed to run on LSF (Load Sharing Facility) a workload management system. It uses LSF directives like #BSUB to define job parameters such as job name, queue, working directory, output files, resource requirements like memory (ram_size), number of nodes, cores per node, GPU resources (gpu_per_node, gpu_resource_name), and runtime (run_time). It also utilizes environment variables like ENV_JOB_ID to access the job ID assigned by LSF."
