        "The script uses the 'srun' command from SLURM for managing parallel jobs.",
        "The script is designed to run two sets of 'report.py' calculations.",
        "The report.py script is a Python application that utilizes the 'mpi4py' library for MPI communication.",
        "The script requires a conda environment named 'dompt' with 'mpi4py' and Intel backend installed.",
        "The 'report.py' program requires a Python module defined in 'spam.c' for core manipulation.",
        "The script assumes 'mpt' MPI is used as the backend.",
        "The script uses 'scontrol show hostnames' to obtain the list of nodes available.",
        "The script uses 'export OFFSET' to define the starting core for task layout.",
        "The first set of runs uses 'srun --distribution=block' to map tasks to nodes.",
        "The second set of runs uses 'srun --relative' to launch jobs relative to a specific node.",
        "The script launches a total of 8 parallel jobs, 4 in each set.",
        "The script utilizes background execution ('&') and 'wait' for concurrent execution."
