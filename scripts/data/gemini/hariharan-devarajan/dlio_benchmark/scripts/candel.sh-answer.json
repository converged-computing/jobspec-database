        "cobalt": "The script uses COBALT for job scheduling and resource allocation.  It requests 2048 cores from the 'datascience' allocation for 3 hours, using the 'default' queue with the job name 'dlio_candel'.  It also specifies some attributes: 'mcdram=cache:numa=quad'. This indicates that it's using the quad-socket NUMA architecture, and perhaps setting memory caching options.",
        "tensorflow": "The script sources a Tensorflow environment.  It seems to be using Tensorflow version 2.2 with Cray MPI support.",
        "mpich": "The script utilizes the MPICH library for parallel processing. It sets 'MPICH_MAX_THREAD_SAFETY=multiple' to allow multiple threads within each MPI process.  This likely indicates the script utilizes OpenMP, which can be used for thread parallelism within MPI processes.",
        "darshan": "DARSHAN is used for I/O profiling, and the script sets the 'LD_PRELOAD' environment variable to use the darshan library for tracing I/O operations.",
        "python": "The script uses Python to run the dlio_benchmark.py file, which is likely responsible for performing the actual data analysis or processing task.",
        "aprun": "aprun is used to launch the Python application across the allocated compute nodes.  It specifies various options: '-n' for the total number of processes, '-N' for the number of processes per node, '-j' for the number of threads per core, '-cc depth' for the core configuration, '-e' for setting environment variables (OMP_NUM_THREADS, DXT_ENABLE_IO_TRACE), and '-d' for the process distance."
