    "details": "The script utilizes CUDA for parallel processing on a GPU. It uses the 'nvcc' compiler to compile the CUDA code in 'task2.cu' and 'scan.cu' files with optimization flags and standard C++17. The script runs on the 'instruction' partition with a time limit of 10 minutes, requiring one task, one CPU core, one GPU, and 20GB of memory. The 'module load' command ensures the appropriate CUDA version (11.8.0) is loaded for the execution."
