It executes the meta-solver, capturing the execution time and exit code. The results are then written to a file and the temporary directory is cleaned up.\n* **Output Format:** The script outputs a string to a file, which contains information about the domain name, problem name, and execution time.\n\nThe software requirements for this script are:\n\n* **Slurm:** The script is written to be executed under Slurm.\n* **Fast Downward:** This is a planner that is used by the meta-solver.\n* **Meta-Solver:** This is the main program that the script is running.\n\nThe script requires the following resources:\n\n* **Time:** The job is allowed to run for 30 minutes.\n* **Memory:** The job is allocated 4GB of memory.\n* **Partition:** The job is running in the \"naples\" partition.\n* **Disk Space:** The script uses disk space for the temporary directory and for the output file.\n\nThe script also requires email notifications in case of job failure. \n"
