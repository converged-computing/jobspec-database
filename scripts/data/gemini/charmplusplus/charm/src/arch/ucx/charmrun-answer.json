    "details": "This script is a wrapper for launching Charm++ applications using various MPI-based job launchers. It parses command-line arguments to determine the number of nodes, processes per node, and other options.  It then selects the appropriate launcher based on the environment, such as PBS, SLURM, LSF, or a default MPI implementation.  The script also supports debugging features using tools like gdb or lldb.  It is designed to be used in a variety of HPC environments."
