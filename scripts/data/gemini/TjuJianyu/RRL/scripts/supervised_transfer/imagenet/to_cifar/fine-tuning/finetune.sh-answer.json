    "application": "Slurm",
    "details": "This script is designed to run a series of experiments using the Slurm workload manager. It utilizes multiple resources, including GPUs, CPUs, and memory, to perform supervised learning tasks. The script iterates through various combinations of hyperparameters like learning rate, epochs, weight decay, model architectures, datasets, and batch sizes to evaluate their impact on model performance.  It also specifies the number of nodes, GPUs per node, tasks per node, CPUs per task, job name, execution time, and memory allocation for each job. The script launches Python script 'supervised.py' for each experiment, utilizing the srun command and directing output and error logs to designated folders. Finally, it uses the SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID variable to dynamically configure each experiment based on the specific combination of hyperparameters selected for that task."
