It's likely used for compiling the C++ code of the simulation.\n    * **openmpi/3.1.6-gcc-10.2:** This is Open MPI, a high-performance message passing library. It enables parallel processing on multiple nodes.\n    * **vtk/9.0.1:** This is Visualization Toolkit, a library for 3D computer graphics, visualization, and image processing. It's likely used to generate visual output of the simulation.\n    * **cmake/3.18.2:** This is CMake, a cross-platform build system. It's used to configure and build the simulation code.\n* **Resource Requirements:**\n    * **--ntasks=16:** The script requests 16 tasks (processes) to be allocated for the job.\n    * **--ntasks-per-node=4:** It specifies that each node should run 4 tasks. \n    * **--time=10:00:** The job is expected to run for a maximum of 10 hours.\n\nThe script also utilizes a custom build of Open MPI, which is likely tailored to work with the specific SLURM environment. The  `CPATH` and `PATH` variables are adjusted to point to this custom build. \n"
