The `#!/bin/bash` line indicates a Bash script, and the `#SBATCH` directives are specific to SLURM job submissions.\n* **Singularity:** The script utilizes Singularity to run a Docker container with TensorFlow Serving. The `singularity pull` command downloads the container image, and `singularity run` executes it.\n* **Anaconda & conda:** The script uses Anaconda to manage Python environments. It activates the `OSMI` environment.\n* **Python & Pip:** Python is used for both training and benchmarking. `pip` installs necessary packages from `requirements-rivanna.txt`.\n* **TensorFlow & TensorFlow Serving:** The script leverages TensorFlow for training and TensorFlow Serving to deploy the trained model as a REST API.\n* **NVIDIA-SMI:** This command is used to monitor the GPU resources.\n* **Resources:** The script requires access to a GPU for model training and deployment. It also uses CPU, RAM, network, and storage for the other processes. \n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **SLURM Job Submission:** The script defines SLURM directives to allocate resources (nodes, tasks, time, partition, account, GPU access). \n* **Singularity Container:** It uses Singularity to isolate the TensorFlow Serving environment from the host system.\n* **Model Deployment:** The script sets up TensorFlow Serving to provide a REST API for model inference.\n* **Benchmarking:** The `tfs_grpc_client.py` script likely performs performance benchmarking against the deployed TensorFlow Serving model. \n"
