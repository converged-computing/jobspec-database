SLURM is a popular open-source resource manager used for scheduling and managing compute resources on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. \n* **Details:**\n    * **job_name:** The job is named \"HtrA1\".\n    * **partition:** The job is scheduled on the \"mf_nes2.8\" partition, which likely represents a specific set of compute nodes with Intel CPUs running at 2.8GHz.\n    * **nodes:** The job requests 1 node. \n    * **constraint:**  The job has a constraint of \"neh2.8\" which might be related to specific hardware characteristics of the nodes in the \"mf_nes2.8\" partition.\n    * **time:** The job is allowed to run for a maximum of 12 hours.\n    * **memory:** The job requests 16 GB of memory.\n    * **script_to_run:** The script specifies that the actual calculation is performed by a separate script called \"add_ions_loop_3.sh\". This is common practice in SLURM, allowing for modularity and separation of concerns.\n    * **copy_local:**  The script sets `copy_local` to \"yes\". This means the script will copy the contents of the submission directory to a local working directory on the node where the job runs. This is useful for accessing data files and storing results.\n    * **environment_variables:** The script uses several SLURM environment variables to get information about the job's resources, the running node, and the submission directory. This information is used for output, logging, and managing the job's working directory. \n\nThe script uses the SLURM submission commands (`#SBATCH`) to define the resources needed for the job and the script itself defines the actions to be performed on the cluster. The `add_ions_loop_3.sh` script likely performs the actual computational work. \n"
