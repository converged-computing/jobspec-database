    "application": "LAMMPS",
    "details": "The script runs a LAMMPS simulation on the OSC Pitzer cluster using the Intel compiler (version 19.0.5), MVAPICH2 (version 2.3.4), and LAMMPS (version 3Mar20). It submits a job with a maximum runtime of 30 minutes, requesting 2 nodes.  The script utilizes the `sbcast` command to copy an input file ('in.crack') from a shared location to the temporary directory for the job.  The script also sets the number of OpenMP threads per node to the number of available CPUs on each node using the environment variable `SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE`.  The `srun` command is used to launch the LAMMPS simulation on 2 MPI processes, and it exports all environment variables to the spawned processes."
