    "details": "The script utilizes the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package, requiring the Intel compiler (version 19.0.5), MVAPICH2 (version 2.3.4), and LAMMPS (version 3Mar20). It utilizes the SLURM workload manager for job submission and resource allocation. The script requests 2 nodes and a 30-minute runtime. OpenMP is enabled using the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS set to the number of CPUs per node provided by SLURM. The script also utilizes the sbcast command to distribute the input file 'in.crack' to all nodes."
