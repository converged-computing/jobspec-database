    "details": "The script uses the VTune Amplifier XE to collect performance data for the \"main\" executable using the \"knc-general-exploration\" collection method. It enables VPU and TLB metrics, and saves the results in the \"../vtune\" directory. The script iterates through different input files (gsm_106857 and kron_g500-logn19) and adjusts the counter variable to control the specific input files used. It appears to be running on a platform with Intel Xeon Phi processors, as indicated by the use of \"MIC_LD_LIBRARY_PATH\" and \"amplxe-cl\". The script also utilizes the \"module load\" command, suggesting it's running on a system using a module system for managing software environments."
