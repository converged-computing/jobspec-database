It allows for PBS/Torque-style and SGE-style job submission with dependencies without requiring the full dependency graph at submission time. It's not as efficient as HTCondor's DAGMan or as functional as SGE's `qsub`/`qalter`, but provides a minimal adaptor for using software originally designed for PBS/Torque/SGE in an HTCondor pool.\\n\\nThis script parses command line arguments and potentially batch files containing PBS or SGE commands. It creates a HTCondor submit file and submits the job, handling job dependencies, deferral times, resource requirements, and other options. The script also supports array jobs and provides options for printing the generated submit file and testing the submission process without actually submitting the job.\\n\\nThe script utilizes various HTCondor commands like `condor_submit`, `condor_q`, `condor_history`, and `condor_release` for managing job submissions and dependencies. It also uses standard shell commands like `cat`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `echo`, `read`, `seq`, `mktemp`, `chmod`, `rm`, and `date` for various tasks like file manipulation, parsing, and time management.\"\n}\n```"
