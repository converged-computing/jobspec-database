    "details": "This script is a SLURM job submission script generator for the GEOPM (GEneralized OPtimization of Parallel Machines) toolkit. It takes the number of nodes, application name, experiment directory, and optionally the experiment type as arguments. It then generates a SLURM submission script (test.sbatch) that configures the job and executes a Python experiment script from the specified directory.\n\nThe script relies on several environment variables set in the user's .geopmrc file and potentially in a system-specific environment file. These variables define the location of the GEOPM source directory, working directory, system-specific configurations, user account, and default queue. It also allows for additional user-defined SLURM arguments to be passed in the GEOPM_SBATCH_EXTRA_LINES variable.\n\nThe generated SLURM script uses several SLURM directives to control the job execution: \n\n* #SBATCH -N: Specifies the number of nodes to use\n* #SBATCH -o: Defines the output file for the job\n* #SBATCH -D: Sets the working directory for the job\n* #SBATCH -J: Names the job\n* #SBATCH -t: Specifies the time limit for the job\n* #SBATCH -p: Sets the queue for the job (if defined in the environment)\n* #SBATCH -A: Specifies the account to use (if defined in the environment)\n\nThe script also sources a run_env.sh script from the GEOPM integration directory to set up the environment for the experiment. It defines an output directory based on the job name and ID and executes the Python experiment script from the specified directory, passing in the number of nodes and the output directory as arguments.\n\nThe script uses a few Bash utilities to format and finalize the generated script: \n\n* cat:  to redirect output to a file\n* uniq: to remove duplicate lines in the generated script\n* mv: to rename the temporary file with the generated script"
