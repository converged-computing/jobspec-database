    "description": "This script uses a C++ program to simulate a 2D network of cells. It runs multiple simulations in parallel using SLURM. The script compiles the C++ code and creates a task file containing the commands for each simulation. Then, it submits the task file to SLURM as an array job. This allows the simulations to run concurrently on different nodes of a computing cluster. \n\n The script is designed to simulate jamming in the 2D network of cells, adjusting parameters like number of cells, contact angles, and other variables. The output is stored in a dedicated directory, saving the positions of cells for each simulation. \n\n The script includes a detailed explanation of the input parameters, helping users understand the different variables that control the simulation."
