    "details": "The script uses the Portable Batch System (PBS) to execute a series of benchmarks and applications on a high-performance computing cluster. It utilizes the following resources and tools: \n\n* **PBS:**  A batch system for managing and scheduling jobs on a cluster.  The script uses PBS commands like `#PBS -l` to specify resource requirements such as the number of nodes, CPU cores, MPI processes, and walltime. \n* **pbsdsh:** A command-line utility used in the script to execute commands remotely on nodes managed by PBS. \n* **NEKbone, MILC, UMT, AMG, mpibench, linpak, dgemm, stress, qcd:** A collection of benchmarks and applications for measuring and evaluating the performance of the cluster.  \n\nThe script runs each of these benchmarks and applications on a separate node within the cluster, as indicated by the `pbsdsh` commands and the `#PBS -l select=32:ncpus=2:mpiprocs=1`  PBS resource allocation directive.  The  `#PBS -l walltime=1:00:00` directive sets a runtime limit of one hour for the entire job."
