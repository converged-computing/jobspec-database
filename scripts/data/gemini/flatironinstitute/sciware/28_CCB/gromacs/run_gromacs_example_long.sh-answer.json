    "application": "Gromacs",
    "details": "The script is running a Gromacs simulation using a SLURM job scheduler on a compute cluster. It requests 2 nodes with 120 tasks per node, 1 CPU per task, using the 'rome' and 'ib' constraints on the 'ccb' partition. The job is named 'slurm_gromacs_examplerun_long' and has a run time of 1 hour. It loads specific modules for OpenMPI, CUDA, and Gromacs. The script uses environment variables to set the number of OpenMP threads per MPI process and executes the Gromacs simulation using the 'mdrun' command with specific options for verbosity and output file naming."
