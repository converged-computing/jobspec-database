The file name will include the job ID and task ID.\n    * **error_logs:** The standard error of each task will be written to a file within the \"experiments/logs\" directory. The file name will include the job ID and task ID.\n    * **virtual_env:** The script activates the \"dac\" virtual environment before executing the training script. This ensures the correct dependencies are available.\n    * **experiment_name:** The experiment is named \"3D3M\".\n    * **experiment_dir:** The results of the experiment will be saved in the \"experiments/other_3D3M\" directory.\n    * **training_script:** The script executes the \"dac/train/train_other.py\" script.\n    * **python_version:** The script does not specify a specific Python version. It is assumed the virtual environment \"dac\" is configured with the required Python version.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* The script uses several SLURM variables, such as `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`, which are defined by the workload manager.\n* The script defines a conditional statement to execute the Python command only for tasks with IDs from 1 to 25.\n* The script uses the `exit $?` command to exit with the status code of the Python command.\n"
