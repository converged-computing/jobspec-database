Here's a breakdown of the details from the script:\n\n* **Queue:** \"cefas-ib\" is the specific queue within the LSF system where the job is submitted. This queue is likely configured for high-performance computing with specific resource limitations and priorities.\n* **Project Code:** \"MA011A\" is the project code associated with this job, likely used for accounting and resource allocation.\n* **Cores:** The script requests 28 CPU cores for the job.\n* **Exclusive Access:** The \"-x\" flag ensures that the job will run exclusively on the allocated nodes, preventing interference from other processes.\n* **Node Requirements:**  \"span[ptile=28]\" indicates that the job should run on nodes with a minimum of 28 cores.\n* **Job Name:**  \"whg[1-2]%6\" defines the job name for an array job. This indicates that the job will be run as an array with 2 groups of jobs, each group containing 6 jobs.\n* **Output and Error Files:** The script defines where standard output and error streams should be saved. \n* **Email Notification:** The \"-B\" and \"-N\" flags ensure the user receives email notifications when the job starts and finishes.\n* **Software:**  The script loads two software modules:\n    * **R/3.5.0/gcc-mellanox:**  This line loads a specific version of the R statistical programming language, compiled with the GCC compiler and Mellanox libraries for optimized performance.\n    * **mpi/openmpi/3.1.3/gcc/mellanox:**  This line loads a specific version of OpenMPI (Open Message Passing Interface), a library used for parallel computing. It's compiled with GCC and Mellanox libraries for optimized performance on Mellanox hardware.\n* **Working Directory:**  The script sets the working directory to \"$HOME/git/wk_WKNSMSE_whg.27.47d\". This directory likely contains the code and data for the simulations.\n* **Script:** The script executes \"run_MSE_whg_UEA.r\", likely an R script, with specific command-line arguments. The arguments control various aspects of the simulations, including the number of iterations, years, blocks, parallel environment settings, and other parameters.\n"
