The script iterates through files ending in '_R1_*' within a specified directory. For each file, it retrieves a corresponding '_R2_*' file, performs adapter trimming using bbduk.sh, and then primer trimming using cutadapt. Quality evaluation of reads is also mentioned but not implemented in the provided script."
