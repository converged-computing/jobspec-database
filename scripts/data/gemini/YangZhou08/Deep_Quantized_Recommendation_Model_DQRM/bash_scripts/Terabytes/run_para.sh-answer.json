    "details": "The script is a PBS (Portable Batch System) script. It uses PBS resources for running a program,  allocating 2 nodes with 112 CPUs each in the 'clx' queue.  The script defines variables related to training settings, including the number of tasks (ARGS_NTASKS), processes per node (ARGS_PPN), and the hostfile (ARGS_HOSTFILE). It also calculates the number of nodes (NNODES) and the total number of processes (NP) using the provided hostfile. The script might be part of a larger workflow utilizing PBS for distributed computation."
