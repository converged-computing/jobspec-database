The script automates the process of setting up, running, and managing the execution of the model on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster using the PBS (Portable Batch System) job scheduler.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of the script's functionalities and the resources it utilizes:**\n\n* **Configuration:** The script defines numerous environment variables that control aspects of the model execution, including the number of processors, the simulation duration, file transfer protocols, input and output file paths, and the location of model binaries and data.\n\n* **File Management:** The script handles file transfers between different locations using `scp`, `ln`, and `cp` commands, depending on whether the files are located locally, on a remote machine, or within a designated working directory.\n\n* **Job Submission:** The script submits the Meso-NH simulation as a PBS job using `qsub`. It specifies job parameters like the number of processors, walltime, and job name. The `qstat` command is used to monitor the status of the job.\n\n* **Resource Requirements:** The script requests a specific number of processors (`NCPUS`, `MPIPROCS`) and nodes (`NBNODES`) for the job, reflecting the computational demands of the Meso-NH model. It also specifies a walltime limit for the job, ensuring that the simulation completes within a reasonable timeframe. \n\n* **Output Handling:** The script manages output files and directories, defining their names and locations. It utilizes commands like `mkdir` and `mv` to create and organize directories and move files accordingly.\n\n* **Dependencies:** The script relies on a number of software tools and libraries, including the `mpiexec_mpt` command for MPI execution, `cat` for file concatenation, `ln` for creating symbolic links, `scp` for secure file transfer, `mkdir` and `cp` for creating directories and copying files, `qsub` and `qstat` for submitting and monitoring PBS jobs, and `bc` for basic calculations.\n\nOverall, the script provides a structured and automated environment for running the Meso-NH model on a PBS-based HPC cluster. It manages the model's configuration, resource allocation, file transfers, job submission, and output handling.\n"
