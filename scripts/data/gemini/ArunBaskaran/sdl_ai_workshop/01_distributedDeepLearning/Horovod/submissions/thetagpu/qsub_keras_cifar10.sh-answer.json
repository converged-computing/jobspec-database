    "details": "The script is using the Horovod framework to run a TensorFlow Keras model (tensorflow2_keras_cifar10.py) on a distributed system using GPUs. It leverages Cobalt for job submission and resource management, including specifying the number of nodes (n), runtime (t), queue (q), account (A), and output directory (O). It utilizes the 'conda' environment and 'mpirun' for distributed execution. The script also performs scaling tests with different numbers of MPI processes."
