    "details": "This script is designed to run a ChIP-seq analysis pipeline on a SLURM cluster. It performs a series of steps on a set of fastq files, including:\n\n1. **Quality Control:** Runs FastQC on the input fastq files.\n\n2. **Trimming:** Uses Trim Galore to trim adapters and low-quality bases from the reads.\n\n3. **Alignment:** Aligns the trimmed reads to a reference genome using Bowtie2.\n\n4. **SAM to BAM Conversion:** Converts the aligned SAM file to BAM format using samtools.\n\n5. **Sorting:** Sorts the BAM file by genomic coordinates using samtools.\n\n6. **Duplicate Removal:** Identifies and removes duplicate reads using Picard MarkDuplicates.\n\n7. **Blacklist Filtering:** Removes reads that fall within a blacklist region defined in a BED file.\n\n8. **Chromosome Filtering:** Removes reads from unwanted chromosomes (e.g., chrM, chrUn, _random).\n\n9. **Indexing:** Indexes the final BAM file using samtools.\n\n10. **BigWig Generation:** Creates a normalized bigWig file from the BAM using deepTools bamCoverage.\n\nThe script uses SLURM commands to manage job submission, resource allocation, and array job execution. It also includes several quality control steps and tracks the progress of the pipeline using a step control file.\n\n**Software Requirements:**\n\n* Trimmomatic\n* Trim Galore\n* FastQC\n* Bowtie2\n* SAMtools\n* Picard\n* R\n* BEDTools\n* DeepTools\n\n**Resource Requirements:**\n\n* CPUs: 12\n* Memory: 40G\n* Time: 5 hours\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n* A summary file containing information about the reads and quality control metrics\n* A normalized bigWig file\n* A series of intermediate files, such as trimmed fastq files, aligned BAM files, and filtered BAM files."
