    "details": "The script is designed to run on a SLURM cluster, leveraging its resource management capabilities. It uses the following SLURM directives:\n\n* `--job-name=peakAnalysis`: Specifies the job name as 'peakAnalysis'.\n* `--cpus-per-task=8`: Requests 8 CPU cores per task.\n* `--mem=20G`: Allocates 20 GB of memory to the job.\n* `--time=24:00:00`: Sets a time limit of 24 hours for the job.\n* `-p short`:  Assigns the job to the 'short' partition, likely for shorter-running tasks.\n* `-o /home/jmendietaes/jobsSlurm/outErr/%x_%A_%a.out`: Directs standard output to a file named according to the job ID in the `/home/jmendietaes/jobsSlurm/outErr/` directory.\n* `-e /home/jmendietaes/jobsSlurm/outErr/%x_%A_%a.err`:  Directs error output to a file named according to the job ID in the `/home/jmendietaes/jobsSlurm/outErr/` directory.\n\nThe script then proceeds to perform peak analysis using MACS2, annotate peaks with HOMER, and calculate read counts within the peaks using featureCounts. The script also generates a final table summarizing the results."
