    "script_description": "This Bash script uses Slurm to submit a D4EST simulation using MPI. It iterates through a series of parameter combinations for the simulation and creates a directory for each one.  The script also uses a series of functions to generate the necessary files for the simulation, including an input file and a submit script.",
    "notes": "This script assumes that the D4EST executable and configuration files are located in a directory specified by the `executable_path` variable."
