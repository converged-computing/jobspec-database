Each job runs a different configuration of a deep learning model, including: \\n\\n- **Model:** resnet50, resnet_small\\n- **Dataset:** cifar10, small_imagenet\\n- **Optimizer:** KFAC, SAM, SGD\\n- **Pruning:** (some jobs involve pruning)\\n- **FFCV:** (some jobs use FFCV for data loading)\\n- **Resource Allocation:** Each job uses 1 node, 1 GPU, and a 24-hour time limit. The jobs are submitted to the 'small' partition, which is likely a smaller cluster node for quick turnaround. \\n- **Email Notifications:** The script sets up email notifications to be sent to sclaam@leeds.ac.uk upon job completion, failure, or any other status changes. \\n- **Output and Error Files:** Each job directs its output to a separate file. The names of these output files are structured to track the specific job parameters. For example, 'kfac_optim_rf_1_cifar10_rs.err' would indicate an error file for a job using KFAC optimizer, random forest, CIFAR10 dataset, level 1 pruning.\\n- **Job Name:** Each job is given a descriptive name, again, reflecting the parameters. For example, 'Kfac_optim_rf_1_cifar10_rs' would be the job name for a job using KFAC optimizer, random forest, CIFAR10 dataset, level 1 pruning.\\n- **Runtime Script:** The jobs call 'slurm_2nd_order.sh', 'slurm_run.sh', or 'slurm_run_ffcv.sh' to execute the actual deep learning training. These scripts would contain the specific code and configurations for each job. \\n- **Checkpoint Resuming:**  The script also includes lines to resume training from specific checkpoints. These lines utilize the 'sbatch' command again to submit new jobs, but this time they include a checkpoint file path, allowing the model to pick up where it left off. \"\n}\n```"
