    "description": "This script is used to submit a Nek5000 simulation job to a Cray system or a desktop using PBS and MPI respectively. It allows specifying various parameters like walltime, nodes, debug mode, and additional submit arguments. It also automatically finds and handles the .rea file, creates necessary output files, and handles submission based on the system it's running on."
