This likely provides functions related to dynamic functional input control (dFIC).\n* **Resources:**\n    * **Memory:** The script requires 32GB of memory as specified by `--mem=32G`.\n    * **CPUs:** It utilizes 12 CPUs as specified by `--cpus-per-task=12`.\n    * **Runtime:** The script has a maximum runtime of 72 hours, defined by `--time=72:00:00`.\n    * **Parallel Computing Toolbox:** The script leverages parallel processing capabilities of MATLAB, potentially through `parpool` or related functions, which likely requires the Parallel Computing Toolbox. \n\n**Details about the Script:**\n\n* **SBATCH Commands:** These are directives for a cluster job scheduler like SLURM. They manage job resources and execution.\n* **MATLAB Code:**\n    * The script performs a homeostatic fitting process, likely simulating some biological system.\n    * It uses a dynamic functional input control model.\n    * The code includes parameter sweeps, multiple iterations, and output saving to `.mat` files.\n    * It appears to be investigating different ranges for model parameters like `DECAY`, `LR`, and `G` with multiple random seeds.\n    * The code uses Bayesian optimization for parameter search. \n    * It utilizes C++ code compiled with `mex` for potentially computationally intensive parts.\n\n**Note:** While the script provides details about resource requirements, the exact nature of the biological model and the specific algorithms employed can't be determined with certainty without a deeper analysis of the C++ code and the biological context. \n"
