        "script_purpose": "This script appears to automate the execution and analysis of LAMMPS simulations.",
        "input_files": "The script expects 'aiida.in' and 'aiida.out' files in each subdirectory 'pos_*'.",
        "output_files": "The script generates an 'espresso-out' file and uses 'getEnergies_byLammps.py' to process it.",

            "memory": "The script calculates the required memory based on 'Estimated total dynamical RAM' from 'aiida.out'.",
            "nodes": "The script calculates the number of nodes needed based on the memory requirement and uses 'sbatch' to submit the job to a cluster.",
            "other_requirements": "The script modifies the 'submit.sh' file to adjust the number of nodes and MPI processes based on calculated values."

        "dependencies": "The script relies on external tools like 'awk', 'sed', 'grep', 'ls', 'cut', and 'sbatch'.",
        "workflow": "The script iterates through directories 'pos_*', reads information from 'aiida.in' and 'aiida.out' files, calculates resource requirements, adjusts the 'submit.sh' file, and submits the LAMMPS job using 'sbatch'."
