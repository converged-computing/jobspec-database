    "details": "The script utilizes the Cobalt job scheduler for resource management, specifically requesting 2 nodes with a runtime of 1 hour on the 'theta-gpu' queue. It leverages the 'conda' environment manager to load the required Python packages and the 'horovod' framework for distributed training across the allocated nodes. The script launches multiple processes using 'mpirun', each process running the Python script 'tensorflow2_keras_cifar10.py'. The script uses the 'gpu' device for training, running for 32 epochs, and outputting the results to the 'results/thetagpu' directory."
