        "The script sets up the environment by sourcing the Intel compilers and MKL library, PGI compilers, and OpenMPI-Intel installation.",
        "It checks the versions of Python, mpif90, mpicc, and mpirun.",
        "It defines the project name and the NWCHEM executable location.",
        "It sets up a local scratch directory (TMPDIR) on the node and copies the input geometry file to the directory.",
        "It runs NWChem using mpirun with the specified number of CPUs.",
        "Finally, it copies the converged geometry to the home directory, deletes the scratch directory, and prints the date and time of the job completion."
