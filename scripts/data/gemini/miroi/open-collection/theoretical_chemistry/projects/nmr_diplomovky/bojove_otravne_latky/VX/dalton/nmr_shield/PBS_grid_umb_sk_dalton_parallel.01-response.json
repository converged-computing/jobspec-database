PBS is a workload management system that enables users to submit, manage, and monitor jobs on a cluster of computers. \n* **Software:**\n    * **Dalton:** A quantum chemistry program used for molecular electronic structure calculations.\n    * **OpenMPI:** A high-performance message passing library that facilitates parallel computing.\n    * **Intel Fortran/C/C++:** A suite of compilers for programming in Fortran, C, and C++.\n    * **MKL (Math Kernel Library):** A library providing optimized mathematical functions for numerical computations.\n    * **CMake:** A cross-platform build system that automates the process of compiling software.\n    * **Python:** A general-purpose programming language used for scripting and data analysis.\n* **Resource Requirements:** The script requests specific resources for its execution within the PBS environment. \n    * **Nodes:** The job needs one computational node.\n    * **ppn:** The node should have 12 processors (cores) allocated.\n    * **Walltime:** The job is allowed to run for a maximum of 100 hours.\n    * **Memory:** The job requires 42 GB of memory.\n    * **Queue:** The job is submitted to the \"batch\" queue, which is likely a general-purpose queue for running jobs.\n    * **Email:** The user requests to receive an email notification upon job completion.\n* **Environment Variables:** Several environment variables are set within the script. These variables define settings and locations of software, libraries, and temporary directories used by the program. \n    * **DALTON_TMPDIR:** Specifies the location of a temporary scratch directory for Dalton calculations.\n    * **MKL_NUM_THREADS:** Controls the number of threads used by MKL for parallel operations.\n    * **MKL_DYNAMIC:** Determines whether MKL dynamically adjusts the number of threads based on available resources.\n    * **OMP_NUM_THREADS:** Sets the number of threads for OpenMP parallelization.\n    * **OMP_DYNAMIC:** Controls whether OpenMP dynamically adjusts the number of threads used.\n    * **LD_LIBRARY_PATH:** Sets the search path for dynamic libraries, indicating the location of OpenMPI libraries.\n    * **PATH:** Specifies the directories where executable files are located, including the path to the OpenMPI binaries.\n\nThe script utilizes PBS commands for resource allocation, sets environmental variables, and launches a Dalton calculation utilizing parallel processing and OpenMPI. It demonstrates a typical workflow for running complex scientific simulations within a high-performance computing environment.\n"
