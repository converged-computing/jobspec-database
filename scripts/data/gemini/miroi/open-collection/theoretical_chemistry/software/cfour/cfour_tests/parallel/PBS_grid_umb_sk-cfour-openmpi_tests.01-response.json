The script uses a number of other software packages, including OpenMPI for parallel processing, Intel Fortran/C/C++ compilers, Intel MKL math library, Python, libnuma for NUMA aware memory allocation, and PBS (Portable Batch System) for job scheduling. \n\nThe script also sets a number of environment variables, including:\n\n* `CFOUR`: The path to the CFOUR installation directory.\n* `PATH`: The system path, which is updated to include the CFOUR binaries directory.\n* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: The library path, which is updated to include the OpenMPI libraries and libnuma library.\n* `PMIX_MCA_gds`: The OpenMPI GDS (global data store) configuration.\n* `OMP_NUM_THREADS`: The number of threads to use for OpenMP parallel processing.\n* `MKL_DYNAMIC`: Whether to dynamically adjust the number of threads used by Intel MKL.\n* `OMP_DYNAMIC`: Whether to dynamically adjust the number of threads used by OpenMP.\n* `MKL_NUM_THREADS`: The number of threads to use by Intel MKL.\n* `CFOUR_NUM_CORES`: The number of cores to use for CFOUR calculations.\n\nThe script is configured to run on a single node with 8 processors (ppn=8). It requests a walltime of 5 hours and 16GB of memory. The script is submitted to the \"batch\" queue.\n"
