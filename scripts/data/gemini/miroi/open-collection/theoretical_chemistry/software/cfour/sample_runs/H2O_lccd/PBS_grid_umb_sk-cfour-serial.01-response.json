However, the code doesn't explicitly call `mpirun` to launch a parallel job.\n* **Environment Variables:** The script uses various environment variables to configure the software execution. These variables can have significant impact on the performance and resource usage of the calculation.\n* **Memory and CPU Allocation:** The PBS directives control the allocation of memory and CPU resources. The exact memory and CPU requirements for the CFOUR calculation will depend on the specific chemical system being studied. \n"
