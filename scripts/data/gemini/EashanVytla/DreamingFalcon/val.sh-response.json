It utilizes several resources and configurations:\n\n- **Job Name:** \"DreamerTraining_Prelim\" for identification\n- **Nodes:** 1 node is allocated for the job\n- **Tasks per Node:** 28 tasks (likely processes) are launched on each node\n- **GPUs per Node:** 1 GPU is assigned to each node\n- **GPU CMode:** \"shared\" indicates the GPU resources are shared among the tasks\n- **Time:** The job is allowed to run for 1 hour\n- **Account:** \"PAS2152\" is the accounting group associated with the job\n- **Mail Type:** \"ALL\" means the user will receive email notifications for all job events\n- **Modules:** \"miniconda3/23.3.1-py310\" and \"cuda/12.3.0\" are loaded, likely for Python and CUDA environments\n- **Environment:** \"pytorch\" environment is activated, indicating Python's PyTorch library is used\n- **Scripts:** \"valid_dynamics.py\" and \"test_dynamics.py\" are executed in sequence\n\nThe script leverages Slurm to manage resources and run two Python scripts, likely for machine learning tasks involving dynamics modeling, perhaps in the context of reinforcement learning or robotics.\n"
