This allows for the efficient scheduling and execution of computationally demanding tasks on a cluster.\n* **Software:** \n    * **samtools:** This is a suite of tools for manipulating and analyzing sequence alignment data in the SAM and BAM formats. It's used for converting SAM to BAM, sorting, indexing, and generating pileup files.\n    * **bwa:** (implied from the script's input file structure) is a tool for aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome. The script assumes that alignment has already been performed using bwa.\n    * **sed:**  This is a stream editor used for modifying text files, specifically used to extract the PBS array ID from a CSV file containing job parameters.\n* **Resources:**\n    * **walltime:** The script requests a maximum runtime of 2 hours.\n    * **nodes:**  The script uses 1 node with 1 processor. \n    * **pmem:** The script requires 4GB of memory.\n    * **queue:** The script is submitted to the \"bio\" queue, likely a queue specifically for bioinformatics jobs. \n    * **output_directory:**  Output files are written to `/scratch/lfs/sugrue/scripts/PBS_LOGS/mpileup_splicing_bt`.\n    * **reference_genome:**  The reference genome for alignment is located at `/scratch/lfs/sugrue/references/splicing/hg19_splicing_catalogue_176bp.fa`.\n* **Other:**\n    * **Script purpose:** This script performs the final steps of analyzing splicing events, including conversion of alignments from SAM to BAM, sorting and indexing the BAM file, and generating a pileup file for further analysis.\n    * **Input format:** The script assumes the input is in SAM format.\n    * **Output format:** The script generates a sorted, indexed BAM file and a pileup file. \n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **PBS array:** The script is designed to be run as a PBS array. This allows the same script to be run on different data sets by specifying different parameters via a design file (in this case, `sugrue_file_list.csv`). \n* **Dynamic naming:**  The script creates unique file names based on variables parsed from the design file and the PBS array ID.\n* **Logging:** The script generates log files to track the progress and any potential errors during execution.\n"
