The script utilizes **R**, **Miniconda3** and **lmod** for environment management and software dependencies. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the script and its details:\n\n* **Slurm:** The script starts with  `#!/bin/sh` indicating it's a shell script, and utilizes Slurm directives (`#SBATCH`) to define the job's resource requirements.  \n    * `--nodes=1`: The job requests one compute node.\n    * `--output`: Specifies the output file for the job's standard output.\n    * `--chdir`: Sets the working directory for the job.\n    * `--job-name`: Names the job.\n    * `--array=1-103`:  Creates an array job with 103 tasks.\n    * `--time=1:00:00`:  Specifies a runtime limit of 1 hour for each task. \n    * `--export=NONE`:  Prevents the environment from being exported to the job. \n\n* **Environment Setup:** The script then sets up the environment with several variables using `export`. These variables define the location of tools and software, including:\n    * `CONDA_ENV`:  Specifies the path to the Anaconda3 environment for R.\n    * `MODULEPATH`: Defines the paths to the module files.\n    * `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: Specifies the paths to libraries.\n    * `PATH`: Defines the paths to executables.\n\n* **Parallel Execution:** \n    * `command -v parallel > /dev/null 2>&1 || { echo \"GNU parallel not found in job environment. Exiting.\"; exit 1; }` : This checks if GNU parallel is available in the environment. \n    * `CHUNK_SIZE=1`: Sets the number of commands to run per task.\n    * `CORES=1`: Specifies the number of cores to use per task.\n    * `THREADS_PER_COMMAND=1`: Sets the number of threads per command. \n    * `sed -n \"$(( (${ARRAY_IND} - 1) * ${CHUNK_SIZE} + 1 )),+$(( ${CHUNK_SIZE} - 1 ))p\" << EOF | parallel -j${CORES} --tag --line-buffer --compress`: This part uses `sed` to select a specific chunk of commands from the list within the `EOF` block.  \n        * The `parallel` command then executes these selected commands concurrently using `-j${CORES}` with a specified number of cores (`CORES`). The `--tag`, `--line-buffer`, and `--compress` options control the parallel execution behavior.\n    * The commands within the `EOF` block are paths to shell scripts (`MDD_1.sh`, `MDD_2.sh`, etc.) that are executed by the parallel process. \n\nThe script is designed to run 103 tasks, each of which will execute a chunk of commands defined within the `EOF` block. This approach effectively distributes the workload to optimize the execution time. \n"
