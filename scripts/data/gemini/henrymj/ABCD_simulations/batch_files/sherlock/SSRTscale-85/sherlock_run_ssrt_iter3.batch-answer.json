        "The script is a Slurm script, designed to run on a cluster with Slurm workload manager.",
        "It uses Slurm's batch submission system to request resources for a job.",
        "The script requests one node (-N 1), 24 MPI tasks (-n 24), and specifies the partition to be 'russpold,normal'.",
        "It sets the job name to 'ssrt' (--job-name=ssrt).",
        "It specifies output and error files (--output, --error).",
        "It sets the maximum runtime for the job to 3 hours (--time=3:00:00).",
        "It requests email notification when the job finishes (--mail-type=END).",
        "It defines the python path for the script.",
        "It activates a conda environment named 'py3-env'.",
        "The script runs the Python script 'compute_indiv_SSRTs.py' 60 times, each time with a different set of subjects.",
        "The python script likely computes individual SSRTs (Stop Signal Reaction Time) using data from the ABCD study."
