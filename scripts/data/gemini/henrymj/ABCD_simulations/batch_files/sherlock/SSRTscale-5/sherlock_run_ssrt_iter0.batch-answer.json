        "Slurm is a job scheduler and resource manager used to submit jobs and manage resources on a high-performance computing cluster.",
        "The script uses Slurm to submit a job named 'ssrt' with specific resource requirements.",
        "The job runs for a maximum of 3 hours and sends an email to henrymj@stanford.edu upon completion.",
        "The script requests one node and 24 MPI tasks, using the 'russpold' and 'normal' partitions.",
        "The script activates the 'py3-env' conda environment using the 'conda activate' command.",
        "It then executes the 'compute_indiv_SSRTs.py' script with multiple arguments, including subject IDs.",
        "The script relies on several software packages, including Python, conda, and MPI."
