    "application": "CAM Topography Updating",
    "details": "This script runs several FORTRAN programs to update FV1-degree CAM topography using a 5-km resolution Greenland CISM geometry. It reads bed topography and thickness from a CISM restart file, converts it to surface topography, merges it into a high-res global topography, and then uses it as input to CAM topography and subgrid-roughness-generating routines. The script requires a large memory footprint and operates on large files. It also uses external libraries and modules like NCL, NCO, Python, SciPy-bundle, and netcdf4-python."
