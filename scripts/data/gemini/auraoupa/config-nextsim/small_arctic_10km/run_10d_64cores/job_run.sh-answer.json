    "details": "The script is using the OAR (Open Application Resource) workload manager to submit a job. It requests 2 nodes and a walltime of 30 minutes. It also specifies an output file (nextsim_small_arctic_10km.out), an error file (nextsim_small_arctic_10km.err), and a project (pr-data-ocean). The script uses the Singularity container runtime to execute the 'nextsim.exec' command within the 'NEXTSIM_IMAGE_NAME' container image. The command itself is designed to run using MPI (Message Passing Interface) with 64 processes, employing specific communication settings to ensure efficient execution."
