        "The script utilizes LULESH, a hydrodynamics code developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, for simulating high-energy physics phenomena.",
        "It leverages the LULESH executable ('stencil') within a loop to run several simulations with different problem sizes and configurations.",
        "The script utilizes the 'jsrun' command for launching and managing parallel executions across multiple nodes and GPUs. It dynamically calculates the number of nodes based on the total available processes and distributes them across the available GPUs.",
        "The script sets up logging for each simulation, capturing output to separate files, and uses profiling tools to analyze performance.",
        "The script employs a modular approach to the execution, loading specific software modules (gcc, cmake, cuda) and customizing the environment variables.",
        "The script defines various parameters for each simulation, such as the problem size, number of time steps, and the number of processors and GPUs allocated."
