        "LSF": "The script uses LSF commands like `BSUB` to manage job submission and resource allocation.",
        "CUDA": "The script utilizes CUDA for GPU acceleration. It loads the CUDA toolkit version 11.7.0.",
        "MPI": "The script employs `jsrun`, a tool used to launch parallel MPI jobs, indicating MPI is used for communication between processes.",
        "LULESH": "The script runs the LULESH benchmark, a scalable code that solves a set of partial differential equations commonly found in physics and engineering applications, like shock wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and explosive detonation. The script is likely testing the performance of LULESH on different node configurations and resolutions."
