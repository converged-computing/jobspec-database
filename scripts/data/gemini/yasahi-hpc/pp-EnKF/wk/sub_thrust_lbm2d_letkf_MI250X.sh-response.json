It leverages several software components and resources:\n\n* **Software**:  \n    * **PrgEnv-amd**: This is a software environment that provides tools and libraries specific to AMD processors.\n    * **amd/5.4.3**: This is likely a specific version of the AMD compiler or development toolkit.\n    * **cray-mpich/8.1.26**:  This is a version of the MPICH library, a message-passing interface library essential for parallel programming.\n    * **craype-accel-amd-gfx90a**: This suggests a library that provides support for accelerating computations on AMD GPUs.\n    * **cmake/3.23.2**: CMake is a build system that helps automate the process of compiling software projects. \n    * **hipcc**: This is the AMD HIP compiler, which enables the use of the HIP programming language to write code that can run on AMD GPUs.\n    * **MPI**: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standard API for parallel programming. It enables tasks to communicate and exchange data across multiple nodes and processors.\n\n* **Resources**:\n    * **1 node**: The simulation requires one compute node for execution.\n    * **4 tasks per node**: This means the simulation is divided into 4 distinct tasks that run in parallel on the single node. \n    * **7 cores per task**: Each of these tasks utilizes 7 CPU cores for computation.\n    * **Time limit: 00:60:00**: The simulation has a runtime limit of 1 hour (60 minutes).\n\nThe script demonstrates an example of running a parallel simulation using a hybrid approach. It leverages multiple processes (MPI) alongside multi-threading (OpenMP) to efficiently utilize available computational resources. The `srun` command is a typical tool used on high-performance computing (HPC) systems to launch parallel jobs. \n"
