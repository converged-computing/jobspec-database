    "details": "The script uses the Tensorflow library (version 1.13.1) for machine learning tasks. It runs on a cluster with 3 nodes, utilizing the 'knl' or 'haswell' architecture. The script utilizes the 'SCRATCH' storage space and requires the 'tensorflow/intel-1.13.1-py36' module to be loaded. The script also uses the 'startCluster.sh' script to start the cluster and the 'test_ipyparallel.py' script for parallel processing.  The script allocates 29 minutes of wall time (00:29:00) and uses the 'premium' QoS (quality of service) setting."
