It is run on a cluster using SLURM for job scheduling and resource management. The script utilizes a GPU (via the `-C gpu` flag) for acceleration.  \n\nThe script requires several supporting libraries and tools, including:\n\n* **SLURM:** This job scheduler is used to manage the execution of the script on the cluster.\n* **nsight-compute:** This profiling tool is used to monitor and analyze the performance of the GPU during training and inference.\n* **HDF5:** This library is likely used for storing and accessing the training and testing datasets.\n* **OpenMP:** This library is used for parallelizing computations on the CPU, potentially for data loading or preprocessing.\n\nThe script also defines a number of resource requirements:\n\n* **GPU:** The script explicitly requests a GPU resource using the `--gres=gpu:1` flag. This indicates that one GPU is needed for each job.\n* **CPU:** The script utilizes multiple CPU cores for processing. The exact number is likely determined by the SLURM configuration.\n* **Memory:** The script will require a significant amount of memory for loading the model and data, as well as for storing intermediate results during training and inference.\n* **Network:** The script may require access to the network for data transfer and communication between nodes.\n\nThe script also utilizes a number of environment variables, such as `OMP_PLACES` and `OMP_PROC_BIND`, to configure the OpenMP environment for optimal performance.\n"
