    "description": "The script is a viral diagnostic pipeline that performs the following steps:\n1. Aligns paired-end sequencing data to a set of potential viruses\n2. Assembles the data into contigs using Megahit\n3. Generates statistics using samtools depth\n4. Creates pairwise alignment using minimap2\n5. Generates a final report as a PDF with a dotplot from the pairwise alignment and statistics"
