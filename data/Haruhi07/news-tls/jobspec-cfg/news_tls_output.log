Few things to date have energized popular Egyptian protests against President Hosni Mubarak as much as the emotional interview given by Wael Ghonim , a 30-year - old Egyptian internet activist , almost immediately after his release from 12 days of detention by the feared state security police . It is fair to talk now about a second stage in the protests against Mubarak 's government as thousands of ordinary Egyptians cast aside their doubts and joined to make the street protests the next day the biggest yet . Why did this one interview , this one person , so galvanize the protest movement ?

For more than a week , opponents of Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak had the upper hand in Cairo , protesting with near impunity in the face of police and an army that did little to stop them .

The morning after Mubarak dramatically announced he would not run for re - election in September , his supporters waded into Tahrir Square by the thousands , and suddenly serious , prolonged violence reigned in central Cairo . There were immediate suspicions that the pro - Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded . Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn Thursday as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square , where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis . CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square , largely held by anti - regime demonstrators , through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum . Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday . The source of the gunfire was not immediately known .

U.S. Seizes Control of AIG With $ 85 Billion Emergency Loan Invoking extraordinary powers granted after the 1929 stock market crash , the government seized control of the insurance giant American International Group to preserve a crucial bulwark of the global financial system . The move to lend the Wall Street giant up to $ 85 billion in exchange for nearly 80 percent of its stock effectively nationalizes one of the central institutions in the crisis that has swept through markets this month . The government had sought to avoid federal intervention by lining up private companies to rescue AIG . But the effort failed when companies were unwilling to take on the massive financial risk , forcing the government 's hand . Wall Street as we know it is kaput . It is not just that Merrill Lynch agreed to be purchased by Bank of America or that the legendary investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy or that the insurance giant AIG is floundering . It is not even that these events followed the failure of the investment bank Bear Stearns or the government 's takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the largest mortgage lenders . What 's really happened is that Wall Street 's business model has collapsed . Greed and fear , which routinely govern financial markets , have seeded this global crisis . What Not to Do in a Financial Crisis : U.S. Learns From Japan How do we avoid becoming another Japan ? That question has prompted U.S. officials to move aggressively in recent weeks as they seek to save the American financial system while avoiding the kinds of regulatory pitfalls that plunged Japan into economic quicksand almost two decades ago . Although the world 's second - largest economy buckled during a collapse of its real estate and stock markets , it was , many analysts say , government mismanagement that made the crisis even worse . Scrambling to Clean Up After A Category 4 Financial Storm Robert Dugger , an economist and hedge - fund partner , says the markets have only just begun to force some financial discipline on the majority of U.S. households . -LRB- By Andrew Harrer -- Bloomberg News -RRB- You know you 're in a heap of trouble when the lender of last resort suddenly runs out of money . Having pumped $ 100 billion into the banking system and lent $ 115 billion more to rescue Bear Stearns and AIG , the Federal Reserve was forced to ask the Treasury yesterday to borrow some extra money to replenish its coffers . Lawmakers Left On the Sidelines As Fed , Treasury Take Swift Action The frenetic pace of the financial crisis has forced the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to make rapid - fire decisions in recent days , leaving Capitol Hill lawmakers effectively impotent -- and frustrated . Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed concern yesterday that they have had no control over when and how federal money has been used to curb the panic on Wall Street . While many have been convinced that the moves so far have been necessary to prevent a wider financial meltdown , they said they felt confined to the sidelines as power to make momentous decisions has been concentrated in very few hands . When newly appointed White House chief of staff Joshua B. Bolten tried to shake up the Bush administration in the spring of 2006 , he spent weeks wooing Goldman Sachs chief executive Henry M. Paulson Jr. to be Treasury secretary . Bolten had personal reasons for thinking Paulson might be a good pick -- Bolten himself had worked for the influential investment bank in Europe in the 1990s -- and Paulson eventually gave in to his persistent lobbying . ` ` I had always trusted him , '' Paulson once said of Bolten in an interview . ` ` I felt a bond and a sense of trust . '' Then - President George W. Bush , center , flanked by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , left , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Securities and Exchange Commission head Christopher Cox , asked Congress to put aside partisan differences and enact a historic rescue package . I thank the treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and SEC Chairman Chris Cox for joining me today . This is a pivotal moment for America 's economy . Problems that originated in the credit markets and first showed up in the area of subprime mortgages have spread throughout our financial system . This has led to an erosion of confidence that has frozen many financial transactions including loans to consumers and to businesses seeking to expand and create jobs . As a result we must act now to protect our nation 's economic health from serious risk . Regarding the Sept. 17 front - page article on the government bailout of American International Group -LRB- AIG -RRB- , which was published a day after the op - ed column ` ` No More Creampuffs , '' about the government being willing to let large firms fail : It seems to me that the market is not really free if oil companies get huge tax breaks and financial institutions such as Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and AIG know that the federal government will bail them out when they make stupid decisions . When the tenor of the federal government is to support and protect big business at the expense of efficiency , the environment , ordinary citizens and international relations , the ` ` free market '' is not operating as it should . Why are all the economic geniuses shocked at the collapse of Lehman Brothers -LRB- front page , Sept. 15 -RRB- ? Why should anyone be surprised at bank failures , given the banks ' investments in subprime mortgages over the past several years ? Their encouragement of rising housing prices made inflated values seem legitimate . In Crucible of Crisis , Paulson , Bernanke , Geithner Forge a Committee of Three The response to the gravest financial crisis in generations has been engineered to a remarkable degree by a committee of three . From the rescue of Bear Stearns to the takeovers of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and American International Group , all the key decisions have been made by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Timothy F. Geithner , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . It is this unusual collaboration among a consummate dealmaker , a professor and a seasoned public servant that could determine how the nation weathers the most profound threat to its economy in modern times . Despite their disparate backgrounds , the three men have formed a close , informal partnership built on rapid - fire phone calls and open debate that breaks the mold of Washington policymaking . As they chart a government response to the crisis , the stakes could hardly be higher . Well , thanks for your patience , everybody . We are , as everybody knows , facing one of the most serious financial crises in this nation 's history . The events of last week , from the failure of Lehman to the bailout of AIG to the continuing volatility in the market , have not just threatened trading floors and high - rises of Wall Street , but the stability and security of our entire global economy . Across this country Americans are worried about whether they can make their mortgage payments or keep their jobs or ensure that their retirement is secure . So truly we 're all in this together .
['– The government\'s bailout of AIG isn\'t going over well with everyone. Here\'s what people are saying: "This is a pivotal moment for America\'s economy," writes Paul Krugman in the New York Times. "We must act now to protect our nation\'s economic health from serious risk." But in the Wall Street Journal, Michael Lewis says the move is "not a rescue plan at all. It\'s a knee-jerk reaction to the worst financial crisis the US has seen since the Great Depression." And in the Washington Post, David Leonhardt writes that the move "effectively nationalizes one of the central institutions in the crisis that has swept through markets this month." "It is not just that Merrill Lynch agreed to be purchased by Bank of America or that the legendary investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy or that the insurance giant AIG is floundering," he writes. "It is not even that these events followed the failure of the investment bank Bear Stearns or the government\'s takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest mortgage lenders." "What\'s really happened is that Wall Street\'s business model has collapsed," writes Andrew Harrer in Bloomberg.

A Government Hand In the Economy Is as Old as the Republic . It has become fashionable to fret that the current crisis on Wall Street marks the end of American capitalism as we know it . ` ` This massive bailout is not the solution , '' Sen. Jim Bunning -LRB- R - Ky . -RRB- The Financial Crisis and You Eve Applebaum and Scott Dominick wonder whether they should buy that perfect condo in Brooklyn . -LRB- Courtesty Of Eve Applebaum -RRB- When Cynthia Shank , 51 , looked at her individual retirement account summary last December , she had $ 448,000 . When she looked at it recently , she had $ 349,000 . ` ` I ' m afraid to look , '' she said . What we are witnessing , in the broadest sense , is the bankruptcy of modern economics . Its conceit has been that we had solved the problem of stability . Oh , there would be periodic recessions , but the prospects of a major economic collapse were negligible because we knew how the system worked and could take steps to prevent it . What 's been so unsettling about the present crisis is that it has not conformed to the standard model of business cycles and has not submitted to familiar textbook solutions . A hallmark of the crisis has been the stark contrast between the ` ` real economy '' of production and jobs and the tumultuous financial markets of stocks , bonds , banks , money funds and the like . GRAPHIC : Karen Yourish and Laura Stanton - The Washington Post , September 30 , 2008 Probe Into Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac Widens District - based Fannie Mae said it ` ` intends to cooperate fully . '' -LRB- By Jay Mallin -- Bloomberg News -RRB- The government probe into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac widened as the mortgage giants disclosed yesterday they are under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission . The companies , which received letters from authorities on Friday informing them of the probes , did not identify the documents investigators are seeking . District - based Fannie Mae said it ` ` intends to cooperate fully with these investigations and inquiries . '' The sale of Wachovia 's banking business to Citigroup yesterday marked the second time in five days that a major U.S. bank was forced from existence in part by fleeing depositors , raising serious questions about the stability of other financial firms and the health of the banking system . The deal also continues the rapid consolidation of an industry that has long been kept fragmented as a matter of public policy but now is being encouraged by the government to conglomerate . In the latest rescue urged by federal regulators , Citigroup agreed to pay $ 2.16 billion for Wachovia , the nation 's third - largest retail and commercial banking franchise . Wachovia was fast - growing and widely admired , run by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. 's former deputy Robert Steel . Citigroup is a long - standing colossus of the American financial services industry . That is the technical economic term that best sums up a day in which the House of Representatives refuses to pass a $ 700 billion rescue plan pushed by the White House and congressional leaders from both parties , Wachovia is taken over in a deal that will have the government potentially owning 10 percent of Citigroup , a few European banks fail , the Federal Reserve and other central banks are forced to inject an additional $ 300 billion into the global banking system , the Dow Jones industrial average plunges 778 points , and investors everywhere rush to the safety of gold and short - term Treasury bills . The basic problem here is that too many people do n't understand the seriousness of the situation . Americans fail to understand that they are facing the real prospect of a decade of little or no economic growth because of the bursting of a credit bubble that they helped create and that now threatens to bring down the global financial system . Politicians worry less about preventing a financial meltdown than about ideology , partisan posturing and teaching people a lesson . Financiers have yet to own up publicly to their own greed , arrogance and incompetence . Tuesday , September 30 , 2008 ; 10:10 AM Most Americans see the current financial situation as a ` ` crisis , '' and there is overwhelming concern that the failure of the House of Representatives to pass the economic recovery package will deepen the problem , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll . But the poll also revealed significant public concern with the bill Congress rejected yesterday , as few voters said the package did enough to protect ` ` ordinary Americans , '' and nearly half said it did not go far enough to shore up the nation 's economy . Nevertheless , nearly nine in 10 expressed concern that the failure of the bill could lead to a more severe economic decline , including a slim majority calling themselves ` ` very worried . '' High levels of concern cross party lines , but Democrats and Republicans have contrasting views of the urgency of the situation . In the poll , 60 percent of Democrats call the economic woes a crisis , compared with 44 percent of Republicans . A bipartisan rebellion in the House killed a $ 700 billion rescue plan for the nation 's financial system yesterday , sending global stock prices plunging , prompting fierce recriminations on the presidential campaign trail and dealing President Bush his worst legislative defeat . House Democratic and Republican leaders vowed to go back into negotiations to devise compromise legislation to stabilize the credit markets , but no talks were scheduled . After U.S. financial markets closed , with the Dow Jones industrial average down a one - day record of 778 points , or 7 percent , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. tried to calm frazzled traders , assuring them that work on a market intervention would resume . ` ` I will continue to work with congressional leaders to find a way forward to pass a comprehensive plan to stabilize our financial system and protect the American people by limiting the prospects of further deterioration in our economy , '' he said . ` ` We ' ve got much work to do , and this is much too important to simply let fail . ''
["– Citigroup’s acquisition of Wachovia is good news for the government, but it’s not good news for the American people, argues EJ Dionne in the Washington Post. Citigroup is “a long—standing colossus of the American financial services industry,” and the government shouldn’t be buying any more of it. “This massive bailout is not the solution,” writes Dionne. “What's been so unsettling about the present crisis has been the stark contrast between the'real economy' of production and jobs and the tumultuous financial markets of stocks, bonds, banks, money funds and the like.” Americans “fail to understand that they are facing the real prospect of a decade of little or no economic growth because of the bursting of a credit bubble that they helped create and that now threatens to bring down the global financial system. Politicians worry less about preventing a financial meltdown than about ideology, partisan posturing, and teaching people a lesson.”"]
ZURICH -- Of all the places in the world , this was supposed to be the safest to stash your wealth during times of calamity , war and financial panic . But here in the heart of Zurich 's financial district , anxious Swiss investors have been lining up to watch the stock tickers in front of the headquarters of UBS , a financial behemoth that has written off a stunning $ 43 billion in loser investments since 2007 , more than any other bank in Europe . ` ` The idea that this could happen in Switzerland is unbelievable , '' said Klaus Stoeckli , 55 , a food - products salesman who has withdrawn about $ 90,000 in investments from UBS , worried that its storied vaults might not be able to protect his money from the global credit crisis . UBS executives say the bank is not in danger of failure . It has cut 7,000 jobs worldwide and is still trying to unload billions of dollars ' worth of risky securities . A decade ago , long before the financial calamity now sweeping the world , the federal government 's economic brain trust heard a clarion warning and declared in unison : You 're wrong . The meeting of the President 's Working Group on Financial Markets on an April day in 1998 brought together Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. -- all Wall Street legends , all opponents to varying degrees of tighter regulation of the financial system that had earned them wealth and power . Their adversary , although also a member of the Working Group , did not belong to their club . How did we get here ? The Washington Post 's Frank Ahrens looks back and breaks down the forces that led to the financial market meltdown . Most of the advice offered to solve the financial crisis has been based on the wrong diagnosis and has naturally offered the wrong remedy . The problem does not derive from a market that failed because of deregulation and that has to be rescued by the government ; the problem originated with government policies and political directives that caused market signals to malfunction .

We are , just now , stuck between eras . The old order -- the Reagan - age institutions built on the premise that the market can do no wrong and the government no right -- is dying . A new order , in which Wall Street plays a diminished role and Washington a larger one , is aborning , but the process is painful and protracted .

'' This Story : Read + | Watch + | Talk + | DUBAI : A sea port of the United Arab Emirates , Dubai is the scene of a $ 60 billion building frenzy . The theory underlying the bailout plan stalled in Congress is that rescuing the finance industry will restore market stability and that the benefits will eventually trickle down to average Americans . Thus , solving the subprime mortgage crisis has morphed into a much larger challenge : reassembling the architecture of the financial markets , which seemingly requires giving the Treasury secretary nearly a trillion dollars and extraordinary latitude to pick winners and losers . There is an easier and more politically palatable fix : Pay off all the delinquent mortgages . The financial crisis is a liquidity crisis , yes , but it is ultimately a product of homeowner failures to pay . Unless this fundamental problem is fixed , we will continue to see -- and need to treat -- the symptoms . Crooked mortgage brokers , greedy investment bankers , oblivious rating agencies and gullible investors have all been faulted in the financial crisis , and there is bipartisan agreement that regulators were asleep at the switch .

Bush Calls Bailout Vital to Economy , Will Meet With McCain and Obama President Bush said yesterday that the credit crisis that has seized world markets could devastate the U.S. economy unless Congress acts quickly to approve a $ 700 billion bailout plan for the nation 's financial system , a message aimed at reluctant lawmakers as much as a deeply skeptical public . ` ` Our entire economy is in danger , '' Bush said in an address from the White House , emphasizing that the massive bailout was not targeted at ` ` any individual company or industry . It is aimed at preserving America 's overall economy .

John McCain and Barack Obama will abandon the campaign trail today for a bipartisan meeting at the White House , as the financial crisis gripping the nation roils the presidential race and leaves the first debate between the nominees in limbo . NEW YORK , Sept. 24 -- John McCain is a gambler by nature , and the bet he placed Wednesday may be among the biggest of his political life . The Republican presidential nominee is hoping that his abrupt decision to suspend campaigning , seek a delay of Friday 's debate with Democrat Barack Obama , and return to Washington to help prod negotiations over a financial rescue package will be seen as the kind of country - first , bipartisan leadership he believes Americans want . What he risks , if things do n't go as he hopes , is a judgment by voters that his move was a reckless act by an impetuous and struggling politician that hardened partisan lines in Washington at just the wrong moment and complicated efforts to deal with the biggest financial crisis in more than half a century . McCain laid out his rationale in stark terms , saying that the economy is in crisis and that he does not believe the package now on the table in Washington can win enough votes to pass .

INEVITABLY , PERHAPS , the deepening financial crisis has spawned a search for scapegoats and quick fixes . According to many Republican members of Congress , banking industry lobbyists and financial pundits , the Wall Street meltdown would not be nearly as bad as it is but for the baleful impact of ` ` mark - to - market '' accounting rules . These are national standards , adopted in the wake of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s , that require banks to carry certain financial assets on their books at the current market price . The idea is to give investors the latest and most objective estimate of a company 's true financial condition -- as opposed to a company 's inevitably self - serving calculation based on original costs . Now that the markets for mortgage - backed securities and derivatives have seized up , however , their market price is either distressingly close to zero or impossible to determine . Sen.

SAO PAULO , Brazil , Nov. 8 -- Brazilian President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva told international finance ministers Saturday that developing countries must be given a greater role in finding solutions to the world 's financial crisis . ` ` This is a global crisis and demands global solutions , '' Lula said in opening remarks at a meeting of the Group of 20 , an organization of major industrialized and developing nations . Barack Obama owes his victory in large measure to the prospect of the longest and deepest economic downturn in a quarter - century and perhaps since the Great Depression . If he performs well , he could become a great president . If he flubs it , he could get the same reception as Jimmy Carter . In the crassest political terms , it was good luck to have the financial crisis hit so close to the election . But Obama 's lucky streak will end in a hurry if he ca n't find a way out of this mess . A Quiet Windfall For U.S. Banks The financial world was fixated on Capitol Hill as Congress battled over the Bush administration 's request for a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking industry . In the midst of this late - September drama , the Treasury Department issued a five - sentence notice that attracted almost no public attention . But corporate tax lawyers quickly realized the enormous implications of the document : Administration officials had just given American banks a windfall of as much as $ 140 billion . The sweeping change to two decades of tax policy escaped the notice of lawmakers for several days , as they remained consumed with the controversial bailout bill . World economic leaders will gather in Washington Saturday for a summit to address the global financial crisis . It is no coincidence that Brazil , China , India and other emerging - market nations have not only been invited to the summit but are expected to play meaningful roles . The credit crunch , which began in the United States , has quickly spread to the developing world . The summit agenda will be dominated by monetary policy coordination and new roles for international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund .

Economic Crisis : Some Are Guilty All Are Responsible Well , I guess the conservative philosophy of ` ` faith '' in free markets that has dominated America for the past 28 years since Ronald Reagan and which was adopted by the religious ` ` right '' as if it was gospel has now been revealed to be what classic religious teaching would call idolatry . And I guess mistrust of government , another conservative article of ` ` faith '' , has turned out to be one of those morally relative judgments now that private financial institutions need bailing out . And I guess the basic religious and spiritual notions of accountability and taking responsibility have been annulled with regard to financial leaders and their institutions that need to be ` ` saved '' . Of all the self - proclaimed experts I wanted to hear from about the financial crisis , the one I looked forward to the most was Nick Leeson , late of Britain 's Barings Bank . In 1995 , he bet hugely on Nikkei futures -LRB- whatever they are -RRB- and lost something like $ 1.4 billion . Leeson was 28 years old and often drunk , Barings was 233 years old and in fiduciary senility .

When the finance ministers of the world 's top economies convened in Washington last month , around the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund , they developed a remarkably successful international strategy for responding to the financial crisis , which had reached panic proportions in the markets . It was promptly implemented at the national level by all the key countries and quelled the worst of the anxieties . When the leaders of the top 20 of these countries meet on Saturday , they must build on that outcome by adopting a similarly global approach to counter the sharp downturn in the world economy that could otherwise become the most severe since the Depression . To do so , the Group of 20 must at a minimum do no harm . Any surfacing of significant conflicts over such contentious issues as internationalization of financial regulation would undermine confidence , which remains extremely fragile , dissipating the hard - won gains to date and throwing markets into a new tailspin . Your browser 's settings may be preventing you from commenting on and viewing comments about this item . See instructions for fixing the problem . Thursday , November 13 , 2008 ; Page A23 The Bush administration initially was n't enthusiastic about this weekend 's meeting of the Group of 20 nations to discuss the global financial crisis . But the summit is going to happen anyway , and maybe that 's the real point . Saturday 's financial summit in Washington will be a good thing in itself : After years of ` ` G-7 '' and ` ` G-8 '' meetings , the new ` ` G-20 '' format will give most of the key emerging economies seats at the world 's top table . The summit could be even better if it spurs governments to pass stimulus packages : Already , China has announced a gargantuan infrastructure spending program that should soften a global recession . But the tricky challenge for the summit is to make global finance safer . To understand how headway could be made on that , it helps to think about finance as you might think about car insurance . Car insurance makes driving possible by pooling the cost of crashes . ` ` This is a decisive moment for the global economy , '' President Bush declared yesterday in New York as leaders from the 20 largest economies headed toward Washington for an emergency meeting on the unfolding global economic crisis .

Although things have evolved considerably since that confab at Bretton Woods , the United States has remained the world 's most successful economy , and the rest of the world has moved , by reason of its example and its prodding , toward an embrace of its economic model . Now that is about to change . As the president acknowledged in his remarks yesterday , the United States , which has gone from the world 's largest creditor to its largest debtor , can no longer expect to dominate the institutions of international finance and will have to share power and influence with rapidly developing countries that generate more of the growth and have more of the world 's capital .

Two of the world 's biggest investment banks , Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers , appeared almost certain to disappear , Merrill into the arms of banking behemoth Bank of America and Lehman into bankruptcy . American International Group , once the country 's largest insurer , was seeking a financial lifeline . This came just seven days after the government took over housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . For all the drama of the weekend , these were the first steps -- but far from the last -- in finding a fundamentally new architecture for the financial world . In taking the top job at Treasury two years ago , Hank Paulson said he would n't be content to keep the seat warm . He was running Goldman Sachs , the preeminent investment bank , and he had no need to come to Washington if he was n't going to make an impact . Until Sunday , it was pretty hard to see where Paulson 's impact lay . His environmental interests had not caused a sprouting of green policies . His strong contacts in China had fostered a bilateral talkfest but no tangible breakthroughs .
['– The government\'s plan to buy stakes in AIG and Merrill Lynch may not be a long-term solution to the financial crisis, but it\'s an important first step, writes David Leonhardt in the New York Times. "This is the first time since the Great Depression that the federal government has stepped in to buy a major financial firm in this way," he writes. "It’s also the first time since the Depression that the federal government has purchased stakes in two major financial firms in this way." If the plan fails, Leonhardt predicts, the crisis will spread to other areas of the economy, including credit markets, which are already feeling the strain. "This is not the end of the crisis," he writes. "It’s just the beginning." Click here for Leonhardt\'s full column.']
Two September shocks will define the presidency of George W. Bush . Stunningly enough , it already seems clear that the second -- the financial crisis that has only begun to unfold -- may well have far greater and more lasting ramifications than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 . That 's because while 9\/11 changed the way we view the world , the current financial crisis has changed the way the world views us . And it will also change , in some very fundamental ways , the way the world works . Of course , the Sept. 11 attacks left a deep scar on the soul of the country and caused immense tragedy .

["– The global financial crisis is worse than the 9/11 attacks because it has changed the way the world views us, writes David Leonhardt in the New York Times. “While 9/11 changed the way we view the world, the current financial crisis has changed the way the world views us,” he writes. “And it will also change, in some very fundamental ways, the way the world works. Of course, the Sept. 11 attacks left a deep scar on the soul of the country and caused immense tragedy.” Iceland's currency has tanked, making the country an international destination for shopping and traditional tourism, notes the LA Times."]
Fed Has Giant , and Opaque , Role in Financial Crisis Aid Wall Street analysts , congressional overseers and the media have parsed every detail of the Treasury Department 's financial rescue program -- $ 250 billion and counting . Largely outside public view , however , the Federal Reserve is lending far more than that amount -- $ 893 billion , roughly the equivalent of the annual economic output of Mexico -- to help a wide range of institutions weather the economic storm . As of last week , the Fed 's loans included $ 507 billion to banks , $ 50 billion to investment firms , $ 70 billion for money market mutual funds , and $ 266 billion to companies that use a form of short - term debt called commercial paper . It is considering a new program that would make billions more available to prop up consumer lending : auto loans , credit cards and the like . In lending these vast sums , the Fed is essentially substituting its own unlimited ability to supply cash for that of private markets , which are not functioning normally . '' Follow The World Desk On : Chiefs of World Bank and International Monetary Fund to Miss United Nations Forum UNITED NATIONS , Nov. 24 -- The chiefs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have declined to participate in a major U.N. conference next week on the financing of development assistance for poor countries , upsetting an effort to secure high - level attendance at a meeting aimed at goading the beleaguered financial giants into stepping up aid . World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick and IMF
['– The chief of the World Bank and the chief of the IMF will not attend a UN conference next week on the global financial crisis, the New York Times reports. The decision by World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick and IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn follows similar snubs by other top officials. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had sought high-level participation at the Nov. 23 conference, to be attended by officials from the IMF and the World Bank.']
The long arm of the global financial crisis reached down into Morena Parada 's preschool classroom , where a little girl named Joeli Arias - Lopez painted bright green and orange splotches on an oversize easel and pronounced it a house . The 4-year - old was blissfully unaware that her school , the Child and Family Network Center , stays open in this converted warehouse with a grant from the now - foundering Freddie Mac Foundation . Or that without that money , which was expected last month , her school , filled with bright puzzles , toys , blocks and dedicated teachers , might end the year early or close down altogether . For 15 years the Freddie Mac Foundation , one of the largest corporate donors in the Washington region , has helped this little preschool , which charges nothing and serves about 150 needy children at six locations in Alexandria and Arlington County , stay afloat . But when the government announced in September that it had taken over the mortgage - finance giant to avert a collapse , officials put all charitable grants on hold , just two days before the preschool 's grant was expected to be approved . A Conversion in ` This Storm ' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had a stern message for more than two dozen of the nation 's most powerful hedge fund managers gathered in the third - floor conference room near his office . Paulson told them it was time to begin regulating the opaque realm of hedge funds , reversing his long - held opposition . ` ` You should not be thinking about how to fight it but how to make it work , '' he recounted telling them at the meeting last month . One manager recalled muttering as he walked out : ` ` What happened to the Hank Paulson we knew ? '' With his 30-month tenure nearing its end , Paulson is leaving behind a legacy of federal interventionism that few would have expected from this former head of the investment giant Goldman Sachs .
['– The Washington Post today takes a look at the Freddie Mac Foundation, the charitable arm of the mortgage giant that was bailed out by the federal government. The foundation is one of the largest corporate donors in the Washington area, but when the government announced that it was taking over Freddie Mac, it put all charitable grants on hold—just two days before a major grant to a local preschool was expected to be approved. The Post also takes a look at the legacy of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who—in his short time on the job—has left behind a legacy of federal interventionism that few would have expected from his former head of the investment giant Goldman Sachs.']

Intelligence officials are warning that the deepening global financial crisis could weaken fragile governments in the world 's most dangerous areas and undermine the ability of the United States and its allies to respond to a new wave of security threats . U.S. government officials and private analysts say the economic turmoil has heightened the short - term risk of a terrorist attack , as radical groups probe for weakening border protections and new gaps in defenses . A protracted financial crisis could threaten the survival of friendly regimes from Pakistan to the Middle East while forcing Western nations to cut spending on defense , intelligence and foreign aid , the sources said . The crisis could also accelerate the shift to a more Asia - centric globe , as rising powers such as China gain more leverage over international financial institutions and greater influence in world capitals . Some of the more troubling and immediate scenarios analysts are weighing involve nuclear - armed Pakistan , which already was being battered by inflation and unemployment before the global financial tsunami hit .

France Plans $ 33 Billion in Economic Stimulus ; Central Banks Cut Rates PARIS , Dec. 4 -- Facing a drastic slowdown , France announced a $ 33 billion economic stimulus plan Thursday , including cash payments to the poor , a bigger rebate on new - car purchases and a speedup in high - cost public works projects . The effort , outlined by President Nicolas Sarkozy , was the latest in a series of programs undertaken by European governments to mitigate economic fallout from the financial crisis that migrated across the Atlantic in September , shaking the continent 's banking system and strangling hopes for growth . Also Thursday , the European Central Bank , with the same objective in mind , announced in Frankfurt that its prime interest rate would be shaved by three - quarters of a percentage point , to 2.5 percent , the largest cut in its history and the second since the crisis erupted . Simultaneously , the Bank of England announced a full - percentage - point cut in its interest rate , pushing it down to 2 percent . The decision marked an effort by Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's government to act in concert with the 15 countries that use the euro to put more cash into the hands of European business owners and households .

Financial Rescues Show That Faith in Free Market Is Shaken Self - reliance . A faith in free markets and a belief that people should have the opportunity to fail or succeed on the basis of their hard work and ingenuity . These are qualities that have been as central to the national identity as they have been to the American economic model . Which is why it is so extraordinary that the government now finds itself hip - deep in the direct management of the financial system , rescuing four of the country 's biggest financial institutions -- Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and now Lehman Brothers -- from the harsh discipline of markets and the consequences of their own misjudgments .
['– The government’s rescue of Lehman Brothers isn’t just about saving the financial system, it’s about sending a message to the American people: We’re serious about fixing our broken financial system, writes David Leonhardt in the New York Times. “We’re sending a message to the American people that we’re serious about fixing this problem,” he writes. “We’re not talking about bailing out the banks. We’re talking about buying up the toxic assets that have piled up on the balance sheets of companies like Lehman.” The government’s move shows that it’s serious about making sure that “the free-market system that has served us so well for so long is not just alive but thriving,” writes Leonhardt. “It’s alive and well because we’ve been able to put our money where our mouth is.” Click here for Leonhardt’s full column.']
Further legislation to deal with the economic crisis should not wait until the new president takes office .

The economy faces two separate problems : the downward spiral of home prices , which hangs over the financial markets , and the decline in aggregate spending , which could cause a deep and prolonged recession .

Unable to Escape Global Crisis , South American Nations Take Financial Action RIO DE JANEIRO , Dec. 9 -- It began with denial , as the leaders of several South American countries insisted their high - stepping economies could weave their way through the financial troubles shaking the United States . Then there was anger that the world 's financial system was being run by apparent gamblers from the same powerful countries that have always lectured South America on the need to be prudent and honest . And now , in more and more countries in this region , there is acceptance .

Experts suspect swine flu has killed more than 100 people in Mexico As international concern about swine flu grows , the BBC 's Jill McGivering asks what relevant lessons have been learned in the past 12 years , since the emergence of the new strain of bird flu and the Sars epidemic . It is new , but it is also familiar - 12 years ago , a new strain of bird flu emerged in Hong Kong that was seen as the possible start of a deadly flu pandemic . Six years ago came the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- Sars -RRB- epidemic . That too was centred on Asia but caused more than 800 deaths worldwide . Since then , there has been massive investment in dealing with a flu - like pandemic . Medical Correspondent , Fergus Walsh , finds out what UK scientists are doing to combat swine flu For years now global health experts have been warning that a flu pandemic was overdue - a new strain would emerge to which there was little immunity , causing widespread epidemics . The fear has been that a pandemic could cause tens of millions of deaths and official predictions here suggest the death toll in the UK could range between 50,000 and 750,000 . This is why there is so much concern about the spread of swine flu , but the plain fact is that no - one knows yet whether this is the virus which will trigger the first pandemic since 1968 . One puzzling element is that there have been no deaths outside Mexico . Swine flu causes regular outbreaks in pigs Infection control experts are scrambling to respond to outbreaks of swine flu in Mexico and the US , and suspected cases elsewhere . Swine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs . Caused by influenza type A , there are regular outbreaks among herds of pigs , where the disease causes high levels of illness but is rarely fatal . It tends to spread in autumn and winter but can circulate all year round . There are many different types of swine flu and like human flu , the infection is constantly changing . WHO flu expert Dr Keiji Fukuda : ` The picture is evolving ' The international community is better prepared than ever to deal with the threatened spread of a new swine flu virus , a top UN health chief has said . As the UN warned the outbreak might become a pandemic , Dr Keiji Fukuda said years of preparing for bird flu had boosted world stocks of anti - virals . Canada is the latest country to confirm cases after as many as 103 deaths in Mexico and 20 cases in the US . Washington has warned the flu may yet claim American lives . BBC reporter on the mood in Mexico City amid empty streets and shops Governments around the world are hurrying to contain the spread of a new swine flu virus after outbreaks were reported in Mexico , the US and Canada . At least 100 people are now suspected to have died of the disease in Mexico . In Europe , health ministers called for an urgent meeting as one case of swine flu was confirmed in Spain . The UN has warned the virus has the potential to become a pandemic , but said the world was better prepared than ever to deal with the threat . Stocks of anti - viral medicines are being readied and travellers are being screened at some airports for symptoms . Swine flu test center is set up Health experts say this strain of virus has been around for 30 years A 24-hour facility has been set up in Leicester to test for possible swine flu cases in the East Midlands . Swabs will be analyzed at the Leicester Royal Infirmary with results potentially available in four hours . The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- has said ` ` some '' people are being tested for the H1N1 virus in the East Midlands , including two in Derbyshire . Dr Roy Fey , from the HPA , said the two had been told to stay at home but stressed there was no need to panic . Vi # t Nam ngn c m c a kh u Ch nh ph nhi u n c ch cents Swine flu outbreak reaches Europe The UN has warned that the virus has the potential to become a pandemic The first cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Europe . Two British people admitted to hospital in Scotland after returning from a holiday in Mexico have been confirmed as having the virus . In Spain , a man has tested positive for swine flu and 17 other people are under investigation , officials said . EU health ministers are to meet on Thursday to discuss the outbreak , which health officials suspect has killed about 150 people in Mexico . HOW SWINE FLU OUTBREAK EMERGED Flu viruses mutate over time causing small changes to proteins on their surface called antigens . If the immune system has met a particular strain of the virus before , it is likely to have some immunity ; but if the antigens are new to the immune system , it will be weakened . The influenza A virus can mutate in two different ways ; antigenic drift , in which existing antigens are subtly altered , and antigenic shift , in which two or more strains combine . Antigenic drift causes slight flu mutations year on year , from which humans have partial , but not complete , immunity . By contrast , the new strain of H1N1 appears to have originated via antigenic shift in Mexican pigs Swine flu : How serious a threat ? The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 form of influenza A With the UK confirming two cases of swine flu and the World Health Organization raising its alert level from three to four , how serious a threat does the disease pose to us all ? WHO says the virus , which has killed an estimated 150 people in Mexico , is showing a ` ` sustained ability '' to pass from human to human and is able to cause community - level outbreaks . The UK 's leading experts on flu give their views on what the future threat might be . Matthew Price reports from Mexico A 23-month - old Mexican child has died of swine flu in Texas - the first death from the virus outside Mexico , where it may have killed as many as 159 people . The child - one of 91 cases of swine flu in the US - had been visiting relatives in Texas when he fell ill . The World Health Organization said the virus was still spreading , even though it was now from person to person . And Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not traveled to Mexico . US : one death , at least 91 confirmed cases The Mexican boy had arrived in the Texan border city of Brownsville on 4 April and developed flu symptoms How flu strains adapt to be able to infect a new species is still a mystery The flu virus is a survivor . It must continually evolve in order to evade its biggest threat - the immune system . Mammals , including humans , make antibodies , which recognize and target the virus . ` ` So it has to keep mutating to escape being destroyed , '' explains David Morens from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Despite these tactics , most of the strains that make people ill during the so - called ` ` flu season '' are sufficiently similar to infections most of us have been exposed to before . Christian Fraser assesses the scene at a pig farm Egypt has begun a mass slaughter of thousands of pigs in an effort to prevent swine flu spreading . The cull was going ahead despite there being no cases of swine flu in Egypt . However , neighbouring Israel has two confirmed cases in humans . ` ` It is decided to slaughter all swine herds present in Egypt , starting from today , '' said Health Minister Hatem el - Gabali , according to Mena news agency . Swine flu has spread from Mexico to several countries around the world . EDGAR HERNANDEZ - FIRST CONFIRMED CASE Edgar Hernandez says he now feels a lot better Five - year - old Edgar Hernandez started feeling unwell in late March , suffering fever , headache and a very sore throat . Edgar was not alone . Several hundred people in his home village of La Gloria , near Perote in the Mexican state of Veracruz had also been sick with a respiratory disease , some falling ill back in December . At the time , doctors told Edgar 's mother , Maria del Carmen Hernandez , that it was just a regular cold . Vials containing samples of the swine flu virus are making their way from the US to a government laboratory north of London . The race for a vaccine is on . Manufacturers are currently working on the seasonal flu vaccine It is a global endeavor and will bring the public and the private together , but it could still take several months before a safe and effective jab is available . Yet amid all this activity , the answer could in fact be right under our noses . Mexico to re - test swine flu cases The widow of swine flu victim Gerardo Leyva first heard of the cause of his death when an Associated Press reporter contacted her , the news agency says Stricter swine flu tests have cut the number of confirmed deaths in Mexico , where the virus was first reported , from 20 to seven , authorities say . But officials warned the number of deaths likely to have been caused by swine flu has risen to 159 with more than 1,300 patients under observation . The number of cases globally is rising though no - one outside Mexico has died . Germany has become the latest country to confirm cases of the H1N1 virus , reporting three sufferers .
["– Health officials around the world are scrambling to contain the spread of swine flu, which has now killed at least 100 people in Mexico and infected at least 20 in the US. The World Health Organization has raised its pandemic alert to phase 5, the highest level, and warned that the disease could turn into a full-blown pandemic by week's end, the AP reports. In Europe, the first cases of the disease have been confirmed in Scotland and Spain, and a 24-hour testing center has been set up in Leicester, England, the BBC reports.

Experts warn swine flu could spark a global pandemic . BBC News online put a number of your questions to flu expert Maureen Baker , Head of Pandemic Planning at the Royal College of General Practitioners . Is there a proper definition of how severe a disease is before it can be classed as a pandemic ? Chris Bonnello , Birmingham Dr Baker : I believe a pandemic is a disease that spreads round the world . Girl tests positive for swine flu Year seven pupils from a school in South Gloucestershire have been given anti - viral drugs after a confirmed case of swine flu in a 12-year - old girl . Some pupils at Downend school have been seen wearing face masks at the school and others have been given Tamiflu as a precautionary measure . A letter has been sent to parents with the symptoms and parents to contact their GP if exhibiting symptoms . The girl tested positive for virus A H1N1 , also known as swine flu . Influenza viruses are able to swap genetic material Preliminary analysis of the swine flu virus suggests it is a fairly mild strain , scientists say . It is believed that a further mutation would be needed in order for the H1N1 virus to cause the mass deaths that have been estimated by some . But at this point , it is impossible to predict with any accuracy how the virus will continue to evolve . UK experts at the National Institute for Medical Research outlined on Friday the work they are due to start on samples of the virus sent from the US . The research , being done at the World Influenza Centre in Mill Hill , will be vital for working out the structure of the virus , where it came from , how quickly it is capable of spreading and its potential to cause illness . Inside the lab where experts are working on a swine flu vaccine British scientists have begun work on a vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus . Their efforts are under way at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control -LRB- NIBSC -RRB- in Hertfordshire . The NIBSC is one of a small group of influenza centres around the world which will create a seed vaccine strain which could then be grown in bulk by manufacturers . Its scientists need a steady hand to drill a hole in a hen 's egg . Police are guarding the Hong Kong hotel where the man stayed About 300 people at a Hong Kong hotel have been placed under quarantine after a guest there became China 's first confirmed swine flu case . The 25-year - old man , who is now in hospital after testing positive for the virus , had traveled from Mexico via Shanghai , Hong Kong 's leader said . Local TV footage showed police wearing masks guarding the hotel exits . Meanwhile , the UK joined Canada , Spain , Germany and the US in reporting person - to - person transmission of the virus . On Friday , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said two people were infected with swine flu , France 's first confirmed cases . The new flat - rate State Pension - how will you be affected ? Paul Lewis takes your calls . American author Jodi Picoult 's new novel , Handle With Care , explores the impact of ` wrongful birth ' litigation on an ordinary New Hampshire family and asks a number of moral questions . Jodi 's first story was called The Lobster Which Misunderstood . She wrote it when she was just five years old Did Mexico over - react on swine flu ? As tests suggest the swine flu virus in Mexico may be less virulent than first feared , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City looks at whether the response was an over - reaction . Pedro Aparicio stocked up on food so his family would not need to go outside Pedro Aparicio shows me his receipt from the supermarket . ` ` My wife thinks I spent too much , '' he says . Just before the partial shutdown of this country , the primary school teacher stocked up on everything he thinks he , his wife , and their young daughter Naomi will need for the next five days .
['– Mexico has shut down much of its economy in an effort to slow the spread of swine flu. Shops, restaurants, bars, and gyms have shut down across the country, and President Calderon has asked people to stay home over the holiday weekend, the BBC reports. Non-essential government services have been halted and many businesses like cinemas and restaurants are closed. Mexican officials say the spread of the virus is slowing, but international experts are more cautious. The World Health Organization has raised its pandemic alert to five, the second-highest level, but says it has no immediate plans for another rise. In Mexico, the number of suspected deaths has risen to 160, and the president has asked people to stay home if they suffer from the illness, the AP reports.']
Mexico and China in swine flu row Mexico 's ambassador says he was denied access to citizens at a hotel A row is growing between Mexico and China over Beijing 's treatment of Mexicans traveling to China following the recent swine flu outbreak . Mexican officials said their citizens were being unfairly confined . The Mexican ambassador was denied access to a group being held at a Beijing hotel . China has urged Mexico to handle the matter ` ` objectively and calmly '' China has denied it is discriminating against Mexican citizens in moves to stem the spread of swine flu . More than 100 people , including many Mexicans , have been quarantined in mainland China since the virus was found in a Mexican man in Hong Kong . Mexican officials said their citizens were being unfairly confined . No - one else has displayed any symptoms . China 's foreign ministry said the move was ` ` a purely medical quarantine issue '' and not an act of discrimination . Eateries in Mexico City have been restricted to offering takeaway food Restaurants and cafes in Mexico City are to reopen on Wednesday after the country recorded a fall in new cases of the swine flu virus . Libraries , museums and churches are to follow suit a day later but cinemas , theaters and bars are to remain closed , the mayor 's office said . Government officials are meeting to discuss when schools and businesses across the country can resume work . More than 1,000 cases of the virus have been reported in 20 countries . Confirmed cases in the US have risen from 226 to 286 , spread over 36 states , with most patients suffering mild symptoms . Swine flu cases close UK school Another nine UK cases of swine flu have been confirmed taking the total to 27 , according to the Health Protection Agency . Five of the nine diagnosed with the H1N1 virus were year seven pupils from Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , south London . It is the fourth school to close . Parents say Alleyn 's School has everything under control Another nine UK cases of swine flu have been confirmed , taking the total to 27 , the Health Protection Agency has said . Five of those diagnosed with the H1N1 virus are year seven pupils at Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , London , which has announced it will close .

The swine flu crisis lays bare the meat industry 's monstrous power The Mexico swine flu outbreak should alert us to a highly globalised industry with global political clout The Mexican swine flu , a genetic chimera probably conceived in the faecal mire of an industrial pigsty , suddenly threatens to give the whole world a fever . The initial outbreaks across North America reveal an infection already traveling at higher velocity than did the last official pandemic strain , the 1968 Hong Kong flu . Stealing the limelight from our officially appointed assassin , H5N1 , this porcine virus is a threat of unknown magnitude . It seems less lethal than Sars in 2003 , but as an influenza it may be more durable than Sars . Professionals may be better prepared to deal with a pandemic . But it does n't mean we are safe For the first time since 1976 , a strain of influenza virus - apparently related to the 1918 - 19 pandemic - has infected the public . More than 1,000 cases have been reported in Mexico , with over 80 deaths . And the disease has now spread to several areas within the United States and to New Zealand .

Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- , according to the UK 's Health Protection Agency . The health secretary , Alan Johnson , said yesterday that Tamiflu had proved effective on patients in Mexico .

When Ros Atkins , a BBC radio presenter , came back to the UK after working in Mexico City , family and friends avoided him like he had , well , swine flu .

Finger pointing towards intensive farming is spreading like the H1N1 virus itself ; it 's time for an urgent inquiry to find out the facts The growing concern over the H1N1 swine flu virus a particularly alarming combination of swine , avian , and human viruses which has now reached the UK seems to have come almost out of nowhere . The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- is now calling the virus , which has infected an estimated 1,000 people and killed around 150 in Mexico , an ` ` international public health emergency '' that could reach global pandemic levels . But as Dr Michael Greger , director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States , has pointed out , this is not the first time a triple hybrid human\/bird\/pig flu virus has been uncovered .

Photograph : Dario Lopez - Mills\/AP A killer virus that has caused at least 20 deaths and sparked widespread panic in Mexico has the potential to become a global pandemic , warn health experts . The World Health Organisation stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert over the swine flu strain a unique mix of human , pig and bird viruses but its director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said the option remained ` ` on the table '' . The virus , which may be responsible for a further 48 deaths in Mexico , has thrown the country into confusion . Saturday 25 April 2009 23.24 BST Swine flu has similar symptoms to the more common , human seasonal form of influenza . It is one of a number of viruses that cause illness among people and animals , causing respiratory problems , fever and fatigue . Avian flu - which has previously been the subject of pandemic fears after humans began contracting it - is another deadly strain . According to the Health Protection Agency , outbreaks of swine flu - a disease caused by type A influenza - regularly affect pigs . Cabin crew member in hospital after flight from swine flu - struck Mexico World Health Organisation has warned countries to be on alert for any unusual flu outbreaks Saturday 25 April 2009 22.09 BST A member of cabin crew was taken to hospital with '' flu - like symptoms '' today after falling ill on a British Airways flight from Mexico City to Heathrow .

Health experts say it has the potential to become a global pandemic . The BA steward was undergoing tests in a London hospital for the swine flu virus after arriving on a flight from Mexico City . It is the first suspected case of the new flu strain to be reported in Europe , prompting fears it may have spread across the Atlantic from Mexico . The influenza strain that has struck Mexico and the United States involves , in many cases , a never - before - seen strain of the H1N1 virus . The flu virus is notorious for its ability to mutate and evolve new features that allows it to escape the immune defense systems of its victims . The appearance of new flu strains is therefore a perennial problem for doctors and scientists . And experts warned last night that it may be too late to contain the new outbreak , given how widespread the known cases are . If the confirmed deaths are the first signs of a pandemic , then cases are probably incubating around the world by now , said Dr Michael Osterholm , a flu expert at the University of Minnesota . Mexican swine flu deaths spark worldwide action WHO says virus has killed 81 people in Mexico as US declares public health emergency and travellers ' illnesses prompt concern in Europe and New Zealand Sunday 26 April 2009 18.45 BST People wear surgical masks as a precaution against infection on the Mexico City subway .

The World Health Organisation said at least 81 people had died from severe pneumonia caused by the illness in Mexico , and tests on suspected cases were also taking place in Scotland , France and Spain . The US declared a public health emergency as 20 cases were confirmed in the country , including eight in New York City , one in Ohio , two in Kansas and seven in California . Sunday 26 April 2009 11.25 BST An electron micrograph of the A H1N1 swine influenza virus . Photograph : Centers for Disease Control\/Reuters It is a contagious respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses . The influenza pandemic of 1918 The current swine flu outbreak is of the same strain , H1N1 , as the great flu pandemic of 1918 . What is swine flu ? Swine influenza is a highly contagious disease that causes respiratory illness in pigs . Most outbreaks happen on farms in late autumn and winter , when the virus kills around 1 % to 4 % of the animals it infects . The disease is caused by a type A influenza virus , and the new strain belongs to the most common subtype , known as H1N1 . Experts are particularly anxious about flu viruses that spread from pigs to humans , because the animals can harbor several flu viruses at once , which can swap genes around and become more virulent .
['– The death toll from the swine flu outbreak in Mexico has climbed to 81, the World Health Organization said today, and it could turn into a global pandemic. WHO chief Margaret Chan said that although the outbreak is unique in its mix of human, pig, and bird viruses, the organization is still considering a global alert. The number of suspected cases in the US rose to 20 today, including 8 in New York City, 2 in Kansas, and 7 in California, reports the Los Angeles Times. A British Airways cabin steward who fell ill on a flight from Mexico City to London is being treated in a London hospital for flu-like symptoms. He is the first suspected case of the new flu strain to be reported in Europe, prompting fears it may have spread across the Atlantic from Mexico. Click here for more on the outbreak.']

CHICAGO | We d Apr 29 , 2009 10:56 pm BST CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Using a new tracking tool , search engine giant Google said on Wednesday it saw a spike in searches for information about flu among people in Mexico last week even before news of the outbreak became widely known . By Niu Shuping and Ken Wills Nevermind that the H1N1 ` ` swine '' flu , which has killed more than 150 people in Mexico , is not directly caused by pigs and has so far not led to any outbreaks among pigs . Nevermind that the World Health Organization has ruled out any risk of infection to humans from eating pork . Nevermind that the influenza - A virus contains DNA from avian and human as well as swine H1N1 viruses , but unfortunately -LRB- for the pork industry -RRB- has been tagged as ` ` swine flu '' by global health authorities and therefore by the media . The net result is that , amid the confusion and potential risks of appearing unprepared , at least six countries have decided to panic over pigs , imposing import bans on live pigs and pork products from Mexico and the United States . Indeed , the country with the largest pig population in the world -- China -- is going full - bore on a perceived threat to the domestic pig industry .

What is the deal with advertising a story from 5 months ago in late October ? ? ? The little doggie is so cute . He must not have taken the H1N1 vaccine .

The terrier, who has not been named, was playing with Obama's missus, Valerie Jarrett, at the time, a White House aide tells the New York Daily News."]

Brian Sedgemore -LRB- r -RRB- with Charles Kennedy this morning . Photograph : Gareth Fuller\/PA Brian Sedgemore , a Labor MP for 27 years , has defected to the Liberal Democrats and urged voters to give Tony Blair a ` ` bloody nose '' at the general election next week . Mr Sedgemore , who is standing down from parliament and not contesting his Hackney South and Shoreditch seat , said he was leaving Labor after becoming increasingly disillusioned with the government over the Iraq war and ` ` authoritarian '' anti - terrorism legislation . He accused the prime minister of telling ` ` stomach - turning lies '' over Iraq and using the ` ` politics of fear to drive through parliament a deeply authoritarian set of law and order measures '' . Tuesday 26 April 2005 01.44 BST As the prime minister cleaves to the jaw - droppingly offensive premise that continued opposition to his Iraq adventure is born of his detractors having ` ` nothing serious to say '' , we are grateful to the brilliant internet comic strip Get Your War On , which alerts us to a tale of such powerful irony that it 's once again worth recalling why we went to war in the first place . Obviously , as far as terms of engagement go , international law has now been supplanted by Mr Blair 's personal reckoning of what ` ` the right thing to do '' is , but back then we vaguely remember some stuff about chemical weapons and , as evidence of the old boy 's willingness to use them , a load of glottal - stopped lip - quivering from the PM about what happened to the Kurds at Halabja . And so to one of the surest signs that this was merely what Alfred Hitchcock called a McGuffin -LRB- a plot device with no intrinsic value in itself -RRB- , with news of the fate of a coalition project , announced after Saddam 's fall in 2003 , to bring clean drinking water to Halabja 's hapless citizens . Specifically , it 's not happening any more . The prime minister is a war criminal Like Chamberlain in the 30s , Blair is an appeaser of a dangerous global power . He should be in prison , not standing for election Tuesday 26 April 2005 01.44 BST Tony Blair has been the worst prime minister since Neville Chamberlain , a figure with whom he shares a number of significant characteristics . Chamberlain was a supremely confident and arrogant politician , an excellent speaker and a deeply religious man with a hotline to God . He had an unassailable majority in parliament , was popular in the country and presided over a cabinet stuffed with nonentities . Wednesday 27 April 2005 07.20 BST The Gulf state of Qatar is considering privatising its satellite TV channel , al - Jazeera , because of pressure from the US and a de facto advertising boycott by Arab countries offended by its critical coverage . Reporters at the station fear that if the channel is privatised commercial pressures could force it to tone down its coverage . Al - Jazeera 's coverage of politics has embroiled Qatar in disputes with almost all of its neighbors , including Saudi Arabia and Iran . What was the legal advice ? Three days before the first US missiles hit Baghdad , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , answered a question in the Lords on the legal basis for the use of military force . In nine short paragraphs he set out his reasoning : that even without the ` ` second resolution '' UK diplomats had been frantically trying to secure , existing UN resolutions permitted an invasion . His argument was that the security council 's authorisation for the 1991 Gulf war -LRB- resolution 678 -RRB- could be reactivated if Iraq were found to be in material breach of its ceasefire conditions -LRB- resolution 687 -RRB- . Since resolution 1441 , unanimously passed the previous November , stated that Iraq had not ` ` fully complied with its obligations to disarm '' , the authority to use force was automatically revived , Lord Goldsmith wrote . Wednesday 27 April 2005 16.50 BST Private Johnson Beharry after receiving his Victoria Cross for his deeds in Iraq . Photograph : Fiona Hanson\/PA The Iraq war hero Johnson Beharry , who twice saved the crew of his armored vehicle from ambushes , received the Victoria Cross today and was told by the Queen : Ruined , cordoned Falluja is emerging as the decade 's monument to brutality Wednesday 27 April 2005 17.57 BST Robert Zoellick is the archetypal US government insider , a man with a brilliant technical mind but zero experience of any coalface or war front . Sliding effortlessly between ivy league academia , the US treasury and corporate boardrooms -LRB- including an advisory post with the scandalous Enron -RRB- , his latest position is the number - two slot at the state department . Yet this ultimate ` ` man of the suites '' did something earlier this month that put the prime minister and the foreign secretary to shame . On their numerous visits to Iraq , neither has ever dared to go outside the heavily fortified green zones of Baghdad and Basra to see life as Iraqis have to live it . It is the duty of the young to go to the barricades for foolish causes , but today 's students would rather drink than demonstrate Wednesday 27 April 2005 01.50 BST At a recent Oxbridge dinner , I heard a college dean remark that he had taken part in two political demonstrations lately , one against the Iraq war and the other against the ban on foxhunting . By contrast , it was some years since his students had marched further than the pub . When undergraduates were told about a forthcoming rent review , college authorities awaited a howl of outrage . Conservative party co - chairman , Liam Fox , and shadow chief secretary to the treasury , George Osborne , unveil the latest Conservative campaign poster . Photograph : Daniel Berehulak\/Getty Michael Howard yesterday paved the way for a bitter end to the general election when the Tories launched a nationwide poster campaign explicitly condemning Tony Blair as a liar . In an echo of the Conservatives ' notorious ` ` demon eyes '' of 1997 , the leadership unveiled a poster of a shifty - looking Mr Blair standing next to a stark message . ` ` If he 's prepared to lie to take us to war , he 's prepared to lie to win an election , '' it says in black lettering on a dark red background . Thursday 28 April 2005 13.03 BST The head of the United Nations weapons inspectors in the run - up to the Iraq war , Hans Blix , last night undercut one of the main grounds offered by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , in his legal advice to Tony Blair . Lord Goldsmith said there would have to be evidence that Iraq was not complying with the inspectors . But Mr Blix , who has since retired to Sweden , said his inspectors found no compelling evidence that Iraq had a hidden arsenal or was blocking the work of the inspectors . He said there had been only small infractions by Iraq . Attorney general feared court challenge Weapons evidence was crucial Thursday 28 April 2005 12.48 BST Tony Blair was told by the government 's most senior law officer in a confidential minute less than two weeks before the war that British participation in the American - led invasion of Iraq could be declared illegal . In a legal opinion Mr Blair has repeatedly refused to publish and never seen by the cabinet , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , spelled out the dangers of going to war , including the prospect of Britain losing a case in an international court . He warned that while he could argue a ` ` reasonable case '' in favor of military action , he was not confident a court would agree . Indeed , a court ` ` might well conclude '' that a new UN resolution was needed before military action could be undertaken . Full text : Iraq legal advice -LRB- part two -RRB- The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 . Read the first part of the advice Thursday 28 April 2005 18.46 BST 20 . It has also been suggested that the final words of OP4 were chosen carefully to avoid the implication that it was for the Security Council to assess whether Iraqi conduct constituted a further material breach . The French proposed to amend OP4 so that Iraqi conduct would only amount to a further material breach ` ` when assessed '' as such by the Council , but this amendment was not accepted . Full text : Iraq legal advice The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 1 . You have asked me for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without a further resolution of the Security Council . This is , of course , a matter we have discussed before . Since then , I have had the benefit of discussions with the Foreign Secretary and Sir Jeremy Greenstock -LRB- the then British ambassador to the UN -RRB- , who have given me valuable background information on the negotiating history of resolution 1441 . Tony Blair at a Labor poster launch this morning . Photograph : Bruno Vincent\/Getty The full 13 pages of the attorney general 's formerly confidential advice on the legality of the Iraq war were today published as the prime minister , Tony Blair , battled accusations that he misled parliament and the cabinet over its contents . The long - lobbied - for disclosure follows the publication on Guardian Unlimited yesterday evening of a two - page summary of the advice .
['– A longtime member of Britain\'s Labor Party is defecting to the Liberal Democrats, and he wants voters to give Tony Blair a "bloody nose" in next week\'s general election. Brian Sedgemore, who has been an MP for 27 years, says he is leaving Labor because Blair used "the politics of fear to drive through parliament a deeply authoritarian set of law and order measures," including tough anti-terror laws, reports the Guardian. "Tony Blair has been the worst prime minister since Neville Chamberlain, a figure with whom he shares a number of significant characteristics," writes Andrew Young in the Telegraph. "Like Chamberlain in the 30s, Blair is an appeaser of a dangerous global power. He should be in prison, not standing for election."']
The man who would not die Ten months ago , a BBC journalist and Irish cameraman set off on a seemingly safe assignment in Saudi Arabia . The trip left the reporter fighting for his life and his colleague dead . Now , for the first time , Frank Gardner tells his extraordinary tale of survival . By James Meek In spite of all he has endured , Frank Gardner retains his BBC voice - clear , measured , concise , registering on my old tape recorder perfectly through the din of helicopters and passenger jets passing over the cafe where we meet . Tuesday 19 April 2005 00.01 BST Iraq 's new rulers split yesterday over whether to execute Saddam Hussein if he is convicted of war crimes , with President Jalal Talabani facing calls to resign if he refuses to sign a death warrant . The Kurdish rebel - turned president said he opposed capital punishment on principle . ` ` Personally , no , I wo n't sign , '' he told the BBC . Tuesday 19 April 2005 08.43 BST Marla Ruzicka , who has been killed by a car bomber near Baghdad airport , was an extraordinary , one - person American aid agency , who worked tirelessly to get compensation for victims of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . Though only 28 when she died , she was an unusual mixture of charm , ebullience , adventure - seeking and tireless dedication to helping ordinary people whose lives had been shattered . She lobbied journalists and diplomats with equal persistence , but loved nothing better than to sit with wretched families after the spotlight had moved on , record every detail of their stories , go out and campaign for official apologies and compensation - and then stay in touch to keep them informed . On the day she died , on Iraq 's most dangerous road , she had been out talking to bereaved families . Her driver\/translator , Faiz Al Salaam , who also died , worked with her for almost two years . Al - Jazeera : the broadcaster has fallen foul of governments across the Middle East The Iranian authorities have shut down the Tehran offices of al - Jazeera , accusing the broadcaster of inflaming ethnic riots in the south of the country . Al - Jazeera said today it had appealed to the government to reverse its decision . ` ` Al - Jazeera assures its audience that it will continue to cover Iranian affairs objectively , comprehensively and in a balanced way , and calls on the relevant Iranian authorities to reconsider the decision to suspend its bureau 's activities , '' the broadcaster said . The Arabic news network was first to report the unrest in Iran 's south - west Khuzestan province near the Iraq border , which has led to 200 arrests over the past few days . Wednesday 20 April 2005 16.26 BST The bodies of 69 people , apparently victims of separate insurgent attacks , were discovered in two locations in Iraq today . The Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani , reported that the bodies of 50 people had been dragged from the Tigris river south of Baghdad . They are believed to be hostages held by insurgents in Madaen , a town south of Baghdad , since earlier this week . Wednesday 20 April 2005 19.40 BST Tony Blair will receive a major boost tomorrow when the Sun endorses Labor for the general election on May 5 , citing the prime minister 's bravery over the Iraq war . Labor strategists , who regarded the Sun 's endorsement in 1997 as one of the key moments of the campaign , will sigh with relief that Rupert Murdoch has not consummated his flirtation with Michael Howard . No Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher has been wooed in the same way as Mr Howard , who was invited to address the News Corporation annual jamboree in Cancun , Mexico .

A poll of 21 countries published yesterday - reflecting opinion in Africa , Latin America , North America , Asia and Europe - showed that a clear majority have grave fears about the next four years . Fifty - eight per cent of the 22,000 who took part in the poll , commissioned by the BBC World Service , said they expected Mr Bush to have a negative impact on peace and security , compared with only 26 % who considered him a positive force . The survey also indicated for the first time that dislike of Mr Bush is translating into a dislike of Americans in general . Tony Blair , in an interview with the Guardian , expressed hope that Mr Bush 's second term would prove to be more consensual than the first .

US ` backed illegal Iraqi oil deals ' Report claims blind eye was turned to sanctions busting by American firms Tuesday 17 May 2005 00.45 BST The United States administration turned a blind eye to extensive sanctions - busting in the prewar sale of Iraqi oil , according to a new Senate investigation . A report released last night by Democratic staff on a Senate investigations committee presents documentary evidence that the Bush administration was made aware of illegal oil sales and kickbacks paid to the Saddam Hussein regime but did nothing to stop them . The scale of the shipments involved dwarfs those previously alleged by the Senate committee against UN staff and European politicians like the British MP , George Galloway , and the former French minister , Charles Pasqua . In fact , the Senate report found that US oil purchases accounted for 52 % of the kickbacks paid to the regime in return for sales of cheap oil - more than the rest of the world put together .

['– British anti-war MP George Galloway went to Capitol Hill yesterday and delivered what the Guardian calls a "stunning ferocity" against senators who accused him of profiting illegally from Iraqi oil sales. He accused the senators of "manufacturing the mother of all smokescreens," and said they were trying to divert attention from the US-led invasion of Iraq by focusing on the testimony of a former Iraqi vice president held prisoner in Abu Ghraib. The senator in charge of the probe at the time, Democrat Tom Harkin, accused Galloway of receiving kickbacks in return for selling Iraqi oil under the UN\'s "Oil for Food" program. Galloway, a prominent critic of the US-led war, said the allegations against him were a "schoolboy howler" based on the testimony of a former Iraqi vice president. Click here for more.']
The prime minister must accept that most British people want the troops out of Iraq Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST Tony Blair insists British troops can not leave Iraq until Iraq 's own police and army can guarantee security . It is , of course , the same argument that George Bush uses to justify keeping close to 150,000 US soldiers in the country . Never mind the fact that pulling foreign troops out would almost certainly improve Iraq 's security , since much of the violence is directed against the occupation . Without the occupation , the insurgency would decline dramatically . Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST In June 1971 , Colonel David Hackworth , probably America 's most decorated soldier in Vietnam , appeared on ABC television and told his countrymen that the war could not be won , that US military leaders had failed to understand or train their men for the nature of the country or the conflict , that Saigon would fall to the communists within five years and that one of every five American casualties had been the victim of so - called friendly fire . This criticism put Hackworth , who has died of cancer aged 73 , under concerted attack from his superiors , an assault made easier to sustain by the fast and loose approach to regulations he had employed as commander of a Blackhawk air cavalry brigade in Vietnam .

['– The US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq has been a "disastrous failure" that has left the Middle East "in a state of civil war," writes Andrew Sullivan in the Daily Beast. It\'s time for the US and its allies to "rise above their differences and work together for a more prosperous, peaceful, and democratic Middle East," he writes. Sullivan calls for a "new era of American-led action" in the region, one in which the US and its allies "do not seek revenge but work together to create a more prosperous, peaceful, and democratic Middle East." He calls for a "new balance of power" between the US and its Middle East allies, with the US taking the lead in the fight against terrorism and the Middle East taking the lead in the fight against weapons of mass destruction. The US and its allies must "reject the politics of fear" and work together to create a more prosperous, peaceful, and democratic Middle East. Click here for Sullivan\'s full column.']
The hunt for Iraq 's lost treasure When thousands of antiquities were looted from Baghdad 's Iraq museum , US marine Matthew Bogdanos pledged to get them back . After two years of sleuthing , he has become a national hero . Julian Borger reports On April 15 , 2003 , in the Iraqi city of Basra , an enraged British journalist whose name has been lost to history stormed up to a US marine colonel and his men and denounced them as ` ` macho assholes '' . The colonel had been looking for weapons and cash left behind by the ousted Iraqi regime , but this reporter believed fiercely that he should be more concerned that ` ` the finest museum in the world has just been looted '' . By a peculiar turn of fate , she had stumbled on the one person in the whole of modern Mesopotamia who both cared deeply about the cultural calamity at Baghdad 's Iraq museum and possessed the expertise , determination and clout to do something about it . Behind the phosphorus clouds are war crimes within war crimes We now know the US also used thermobaric weapons in its assault on Falluja , where up to 50,000 civilians remained The media could n't have made a bigger pig 's ear of the white phosphorus story . So , before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja , I would like to try to clear up the old ones . There is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians . The claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI , called Falluja : the Hidden Massacre . Is talk of withdrawal premature ? Does a ` ` phased withdrawal '' from Iraq in 2006 really herald the beginning of the end for the coalition effort in Iraq ?

The comments , which surfaced in a leaked memo , alleged that the American president considered bombing al - Jazeera 's offices in Doha , the capital of Qatar , at the height of last year 's Iraqi insurgency in Falluja .

Though it has obtained court injunctions against newspapers , the government has never prosecuted editors for publishing the contents of leaked documents , including highly sensitive ones about the run - up to the invasion of Iraq . The attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , last night referred editors to newspaper reports yesterday that described the contents of a memo purporting to be at the center of charges against two men under the secrets act .

Monday 5 September 2005 00.00 BST A Sunni Arab teenager who died saving Shias during last week 's stampede disaster in Baghdad has been hailed as a hero whose sacrifice should unify Iraq . Othman al - Ubeydi drowned after rescuing at least three people who tumbled into the Tigris when Shia pilgrims panicked at rumors of a suicide bomber among them , leading to 1,005 deaths . The 19-year - old student 's face was on newspapers and television screens yesterday and the provincial council said that a street would be named after him . Mr Ubeydi was sitting down to breakfast last Wednesday when loudspeakers from his Sunni mosque said Shias needed help at the al - Aima bridge , where Iraq 's deadliest disaster since the 2003 invasion was unfolding . While hundreds were crushed to death on the bridge , hundreds more jumped or fell into the river . If I knew how dangerous it would be , I might have reconsidered taking the job .

Just as it was branded unpatriotic in the US after the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington to talk about the link with American policy in the Middle East , so those who have raised the evident connection between the London atrocities and Britain 's role in Iraq and Afghanistan have been denounced as traitors . And anyone who has questioned Tony Blair 's echo of George Bush 's fateful words on September 11 that this was an assault on freedom and our way of life has been treated as an apologist for terror .

Mr Cook had apparently collapsed with a suspected heart attack on the mountainside while out walking during his summer holidays . He was also reported to have seriously injured himself in a fall after his collapse . This is an extract from Robin Cook 's resignation speech to the House of Commons , 17 March 2003 . It electrified Parliament and will be remembered as one of the most important addresses in modern Westminster history .

Outside the Mason Hall in Gramercy Park , Manhattan , a long line of people stretched around the block as they queued for the sold - out showdown between Christopher Hitchens , the English journalist and essayist domiciled in America , and George Galloway , the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow . Billed as the Grapple in the Big Apple , this two - Brit debate on the Iraq war had galvanised and divided New York 's political classes in a manner that perhaps no native orators could achieve . For fans of a certain kind of muscular polemic , Hitchens v Galloway was the equivalent of an historic heavyweight prize fight .

That is why events in Baghdad this week , with Iraqi politicians negotiating a draft constitution , are so important to him .

In an unprecedented move that top military commanders have feared since the ICC Act 's introduction in 2001 , British soldiers face prosecution for the war crime of inhuman treatment of detainees , although the men will face court martial in this country rather than being tried in The Hague .

In the Lords last week , former chiefs of defense staff lined up one after another to harangue the Ministry of Defense for succumbing to ` ` political correctness '' by allowing British soldiers to be subjected to legal constraints by lawyers who had no idea what it was like to face not a conventional enemy , but insurgents in Iraq , a uniquely dangerous security environment .

A number of non - commissioned officers who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity - they are forbidden from talking to the press by Queen 's Regulations - said they had been disgusted to learn that more fellow soldiers face prison as a result of their actions in Iraq . One soldier , who served with the Irish Guards in Iraq during the conflict in 2003 and knows the three soldiers charged on Tuesday with war crimes , said : ` ` It 's going to put all the other lads in a horrible position . Everyone is going to be scared to do anything . If they get fired upon , they are going to be scared to fire back .
['– Three British soldiers have been charged with crimes against detainees in Iraq, in what is believed to be an "unprecedented move" by Britain\'s attorney general. The soldiers are the first to be charged with war crimes under the International Criminal Court\'s jurisdiction. Eleven other soldiers have also been charged in connection with incidents in Basra in September 2003, the Guardian reports. Britain\'s Ministry of Defense has been under fire for allowing soldiers to be "subjected to legal constraints by lawyers who had no idea what it was like to face not a conventional enemy, but insurgents in Iraq, a uniquely dangerous security environment," the paper notes.

The highest - ranking US general in Iraq authorised the use of interrogation techniques that included sleep manipulation , stress positions and the use of dogs to ` ` exploit Arab fears '' of them , it emerged today . A memo signed by Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez authorised 29 interrogation techniques , including 12 that exceeded limits in the army 's own field manual and four that it admitted risked falling foul of international law , the Geneva conventions or accepted standards on the humane treatment of prisoners . The memo , dated September 14 2003 , also stated that the Iraq interrogation policy was modelled on the one used at Guantnamo Bay ` ` but modified for applicability to a theater -LRB- sic -RRB- of war in which the Geneva conventions apply '' . On Friday , a US court ordered the papers ' release under the American Freedom of Information Act , following a request by the American Civil Liberties Union . ` ` The memo clearly establishes that Gen Sanchez authorised unlawful interrogation techniques for use in Iraq , and , in particular , these techniques violate the Geneva conventions and the army 's own field manual governing interrogations , '' ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement . US unilateralism was a means of breaking the old order . Now it is building new alliances Thursday 31 March 2005 01.37 BST With any new political phenomenon , there is always a tendency to underestimate its novelty and treat it as some kind of short - term aberration . I vividly recall how long it took commentators and analysts , on the right and left , to recognize that Thatcherism was something quite new and here to stay . Similar doubts greeted the Bush administration and the neocon revolution : its novelty would be short - lived , it would not last and it was just not viable . Thursday 31 March 2005 00.05 BST A final analysis of the intelligence fiasco over Iraq 's non - existent weapons of mass destruction will today focus blame on the CIA and other spy agencies , largely clearing the White House and the Pentagon of allegations that they shaped the intelligence to justify the invasion , according to early accounts of the report . The assessment by a presidential commission on WMD intelligence follows 14 months of mostly secret inquiries in an undisclosed location in Virginia . It reportedly concentrates on mistakes in a multi - agency assessment in October 2002 , the national intelligence estimate , which portrayed Saddam Hussein 's weapons programs as a serious threat to the US . A year - long search by the US Iraq survey group later concluded that those programs had collapsed more than a decade before the invasion . Thursday 31 March 2005 00.05 BST Acute malnutrition among Iraqi children aged under five nearly doubled last year because of chaos caused by the US - led occupation , a United Nations expert said yesterday . Jean Ziegler , the UN Human Rights Commission 's special expert on the right to food , said more than a quarter of Iraqi children do not have enough to eat and 7.7 % are acutely malnourished - a jump from 4 % recorded in the immediate aftermath of the US - led invasion . Reporting to the commission 's headquarters in Geneva , the Swiss professor claimed the situation was ` ` a result of the war led by coalition forces '' . If confirmed , the estimates would be an indictment of an occupation which was supposed to improve the lives of a population crushed by Saddam Hussein . A presidential commission investigating the intelligence debacle that preceded the Iraq invasion reported yesterday that the damage done to US credibility would ` ` take years to undo '' . American intelligence was described by the report as being in chaos , often paralysed by the rivalry of 15 different spy agencies and affected by unchallenged assumptions about Baghdad 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . The incompetence described in the report occasionally descends into farce , particularly over an Iraqi defector codenamed Curveball , whose fabricated tales about mobile biological laboratories and their influence on US decision - makers were reminiscent of Graham Greene 's accidental spy in Our Man in Havana . Despite warnings that he was ` ` crazy '' , ` ` a waste of time '' , and that he had not even been in Iraq at the time of an event he supposedly saw , his claims became the subject of almost 100 Defense Intelligence Agency reports and a focus of the National Intelligence Estimate in October 2002 . Most critically , Curveball 's description of mobile laboratories provided one of the highlights of Colin Powell 's address to the UN security council on February 5 2003 , in which the then US secretary of state laid out the justification for the invasion .

Studies will help scientists tease out problem genes Critics say boundaries being pushed too far Scientists have successfully transplanted human chromosomes into mice , a first that promises to transform medical research into the genetic causes of disease .

About one in a thousand people are born with an extra copy of the chromosome , a genetic hiccup that causes Down 's syndrome . Genetic studies of the mice will help scientists to nail down which genes give rise to medical conditions which are prevalent among people with Down 's syndrome , such as impaired brain development , heart defects , behavioural abnormalities , Alzheimer 's disease and leukemia . Medical researchers yesterday hailed the work as a ` ` tour de force '' , but critics accused the team of pushing the boundaries of genetic manipulation too far and blurring the distinction of what was biologically human .

Tony Blair hopes that , despite continuing and widespread violence in Iraq , the move will show that there is progress following the conflict of 2003 . Britain has already privately informed Japan - which also has troops in Iraq - of its plans to begin withdrawing from southern Iraq in May , a move that officials in Tokyo say would make it impossible for their own 550 soldiers to remain .

Saturday 15 January 2005 16.19 GMT The damage wrought by the construction of an American military base in the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon must rank as one of the most reckless acts of cultural vandalism in recent memory . And all the more so because it was unnecessary and avoidable . The camp did not have to be established in the city - where the Hanging Gardens , one of the seven wonders of the world , once stood - but given that it was , the US authorities were very aware of the warnings of archaeologists of the historic importance of the site . Yet , as a report by Dr John Curtis of the British Museum makes clear , they seem to have ignored the warnings . US - led forces leave a trail of destruction and contamination in architectural site of world importance Saturday 15 January 2005 16.16 GMT Troops from the US - led force in Iraq have caused widespread damage and severe contamination to the remains of the ancient city of Babylon , according to a damning report released today by the British Museum . John Curtis , keeper of the museum 's Ancient Near East department and an authority on Iraq 's many archaeological sites , found ` ` substantial damage '' on an investigative visit to Babylon last month . The ancient city has been used by US and Polish forces as a military depot for the past two years , despite objections from archaeologists . ` ` This is tantamount to establishing a military camp around the Great Pyramid in Egypt or around Stonehenge in Britain , '' says the report , which has been seen by the Guardian . Saturday 15 January 2005 00.03 GMT The chaos of Iraq is giving rise to a new generation of ` ` professional '' terrorists who will eventually replace al - Qaida as a global threat , according to a CIA thinktank . A report by the National Intelligence Council says the war in Iraq has provided a training and recruitment ground for Islamist militants , much as Afghanistan did for the founding generation of al - Qaida during the war against the Soviet occupation in the 1980s . As new terror organizations emerge on the world stage , al - Qaida will splinter into regional separatist groups , says the report , which forecasts global trends over the next 15 years . ` ` Iraq and other possible conflicts in the future could provide recruitment , training grounds , technical skills and language proficiency for a new class of terrorists who are ` professionalised ' and for whom political violence becomes an end in itself , '' the report says . Months of war that ruined centuries of history Cherished monuments defaced and ancient inscribed fragments found in spoil heaps Saturday 15 January 2005 16.18 GMT Iraqi authorities will today take back responsibility for the site of Babylon in a formal handover from the coalition forces . But what they will inherit , say experts , is a catalogue of disasters . According to the report of the British Museum 's John Curtis , the site has been severely contaminated and parts have been irreparably damaged . damage to the dragons decorating the Ishtar Gate , one of the world 's most famous monuments , from attempts to prise out the relief - moulded bricks broken bricks inscribed with the name of Nebuchadnezzar lying in spoil heaps the original brick surface of the great processional route through the gate crushed by military vehicles fuel seeping from tanks into archaeological layers acres of the site levelled , covered with imported gravel - which Dr Curtis said would be impossible to remove without causing further damage - and sprayed with chemicals which are also seeping into the unexcavated buried deposits thousands of tonnes of archaeological material used to fill sandbags and mesh crates , and equally damaging , when that practice stopped , thousands more tonnes of material imported from outside the site , contaminating the site for archaeologists forever .

The base, which has been used by US and Polish forces for the past two years, "is tantamount to establishing a military camp around the Great Pyramid in Egypt or around Stonehenge in Britain," says the report, which was seen by the Guardian. The site has been severely contaminated and parts have been irreparably damaged, according to the report, from attempts to prise out the relief—molded bricks broken bricks inscribed with the name of Nebuchadnezzar lying in spoil heaps the original brick surface of the great processional route through the gate crushed by military vehicles fuel seeping from tanks into archaeological layers acres of the site leveled. When the practice of filling sandbags and mesh crates ended, thousands more tons of archaeological material were imported from outside the site, contaminating the site for archaeologists forever.']
The dangers of exporting democracy Bush 's crusade is based on a dangerous illusion and will fail Saturday 22 January 2005 12.22 GMT Although President Bush 's uncompromising second inaugural address does not so much as mention the words Iraq , Afghanistan and the war on terror , he and his supporters continue to engage in a planned reordering of the world . The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are but one part of a supposedly universal effort to create world order by ` ` spreading democracy '' . This idea is not merely quixotic - it is dangerous . Lawyers weigh charges over nine fresh allegations as government faces demands for full public inquiry The army faces a fresh series of serious allegations of abuse against its forces in Iraq , The Observer has learned . The Ministry of Defense confirmed last night that army prosecution lawyers have completed investigations into nine separate incidents involving British soldiers serving in Iraq and are now actively considering bringing charges on the back of their inquiries . Three of the cases concern incidents in which Iraqis were detained by British forces . Four involve the fatal shooting of Iraqis during military operations and two involve non - fatal injuries . A further 48 cases are still being investigated , while 77 cases have been examined and closed by army lawyers . Monday 24 January 2005 02.16 GMT Plagued by mission fatigue , casualties and a public starting to ask just how long the US plans to keep its soldiers in Iraq , the American army may have come up with a solution : robots . From March or April this year , it plans to deploy 18 armed robots to Iraq to help fight the ` ` war on terror '' . Although the robots have a snappy name - Swords , or Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection Systems - they are n't quite the sleek , cold - blooded androids of I , Robot . Rather , they look more like the sort of contraption dreamt up for the program Robot Wars .

Why city 's defences were down Cuts in spending to raise levees blamed on cost of war in Iraq Thursday 1 September 2005 13.06 BST The Louisiana coastline may have been so badly damaged by the hurricane because manmade engineering of the delta has led to erosion of natural defences , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers . The engineering of the last 100 years that has reworked the Mississippi delta with thousands of miles of levees and flood barriers to protect communities and aid navigation , has also disturbed natural barriers which traditionally prevented storm surges and protected against hurricanes , says the society . ` ` Human activity , directly or indirectly , has caused 1,500 square miles of natural coastal barriers to be eroded in the past 50 years . Katrina comes home to roost President Bush is to blame for the scale of the disaster as a result of his administration 's policies and actions Friday 2 September 2005 10.29 BST Biblical in its uncontrolled rage and scope , the storm has left millions of Americans to scavenge for food and shelter , and hundreds reportedly dead . With its main levee broken , the evacuated city of New Orleans has become part of the Gulf of Mexico . But the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina may not entirely be the result of an act of nature . A year ago the US army corps of engineers proposed to study how New Orleans could be protected from a catastrophic hurricane , but the Bush administration ordered that the research not be undertaken . After a flood killed six people in 1995 , the Congress created the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project . If you want to know what London was like in 1905 , come to Washington in 2005 .

Saturday 3 September 2005 13.38 BST The fallout from the Gulf coast disaster could take a heavy political toll on President George Bush , who has been accused by some of fiddling while New Orleans drowns . His already plummeting popularity rating is likely to take another big hit , according to experts who say the public largely see his response to the tragedy as several days too late , inadequate and insincere . Visiting the storm - wrecked town of Biloxi , Mississippi , Mr Bush hugged a sobbing survivor . The woman , Bronwynne Bassier , 23 , clutched a plastic bag containing all she had rescued from her wrecked home .
['– As New Orleans begins to dig out from under the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the Guardian takes a look at the long-term implications of the storm for the city and the US. Among the findings: New Orleans\' levees were up to 100 years old, but they\'ve eroded by 1,500 square miles over the past 50 years, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The city\'s urban flood control project was supposed to be a long-term fix, but the Bush administration blocked a study of how New Orleans could be protected from a major hurricane. The city\'s levees were already at capacity when Katrina hit, and they\'re not expected to be rebuilt until at least 20 years from now. New Orleans\' infrastructure is in such bad shape that it will take decades to restore it, experts tell the New York Times. "It\'s going to take a long, long time to get it back to normal," says a professor of civil engineering. "It\'s going to take a long, long time to rebuild."']
Lessons from the history man Robert Fisk charts the modern history of the Middle East as he examines the causes of current chaos in The Great War for Civilisation , says Rebecca Seal In 1905 , when the Middle East 's most modern crisis was in its infancy , American philosopher George Santayana wrote : ` Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ' That remark came to mind when reading Robert Fisk 's latest book , which is so much more than a modern history of the Middle East . It starts with Fisk 's hair - raising 1997 meeting with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan , then takes us via many of the trouble spots of the last three decades to conclude in Iraq . Fisk , the Independent 's veteran foreign correspondent , also examines the 1920 occupation of Iraq by British forces , the roots of the Arab - Israeli conflict and other events which lead us to the ludicrous present where soldiers from the most sophisticated armies in the world have to be protected by private security firms in Iraq and where the threat of terrorism is a fact of daily life from Bali to London .

['– Peter Hitchens has a new book out, and it’s a doozy. It’s called The Great War for Civilization, and it takes a look at the last three decades in the Middle East, from Osama bin Laden’s meeting with the al-Qaeda leader in Afghanistan to the US-led invasion of Iraq, writes Robert Fisk in the Independent. The book is “so much more than a modern history of the Middle East,” writes Rebecca Seal in the Guardian. “It starts with Fisk’s hair—raising 1997 meeting with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan—then takes us via many of the trouble spots of the last three decades to conclude in Iraq.”']
George Galloway , the British MP and anti - war campaigner , was labeled a ` ` disgrace '' last night by pro - war journalist Christopher Hitchens , who was himself branded by Mr Galloway as a ` ` slug '' leaving a ` ` trail of slime '' . The two rhetorical heavyweights clashed in a rousing debate on Iraq in New York , both landing painful political blows among the insults , although Mr Galloway , Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , came unstuck when he referred to the September 11 attacks . Mr Hitchens , the British Vanity Fair columnist who has strayed from his left - wing roots , began by imagining what would have happened had the policies of the ` ` so - called anti - war movement '' been followed over the last 15 years . ` ` Saddam Hussein would be the owner and occupier of Kuwait . He would have succeeded in the annexation - not merely the invasion - but the abolition of an Arab and Muslim state that was a member of the Arab League and of the United Nations . A scene from Mike Mackey 's Liberality for All . Photograph : Mike Mackey\/ACC Studios What would a world run by antiwar liberals look like ? That 's the premise of a new comic book , Liberality for All , set in an alternate future in which Al Gore won the 2000 US election and liberals went on to create a dystopia where a corrupt UN , led by the French president , Jacques Chirac , has appeased Islamist fundamentalists and invited Osama bin Laden to give the memorial address on the 20 anniversary of the September 11 attacks . We must not be blackmailed by Merkel 's neoliberal gang Schr der 's government has made mistakes , but it is on the side of the disadvantaged and kept us out of an illegal war As hard as it will be to achieve this result in the German elections , I none the less make the case for the Social Democrat and Green coalition to continue in government under the chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , and the foreign minister , Joschka Fischer . Both have the courage to undertake difficult reforms ; both have demonstrated responsible behavior in the face of crises . Let us recall : four years ago the attack on the World Trade Centre shook America - and Germany . The chancellor promised the US unswerving support in the fight against terrorism - but he added a caveat that Germany would not get involved in military adventures . That warning proved all too necessary . Friday 16 September 2005 11.24 BST Like a boxer bigging himself up before a fight , George Galloway said that he was not in the slightest bit nervous about his forthcoming debate with Christopher Hitchens on whether the Iraq war was justified and necessary . ` ` He 's all washed up , like Sonny Liston , '' said the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow . But in his prime even Liston had attributes that would make his opponents tremble . ` ` He was the big black Negro in every white man 's hallway , waiting to do him in , '' wrote Amiri Baraka in praise of Liston . ` ` A heavy - faced replica of every whipped - up woogie in the world ...
['– Christopher Hitchens and George Galloway debated the merits and demerits of the Iraq war in New York last night, and the fireworks started early. Hitchens called Galloway a "disgrace" and a "trail of slime" in a column in the Guardian.

The back-and-forth continues today: Hitchens: "George Galloway is a disgrace. He is a bigoted liberal who has abandoned his left wing roots. He is a man of few words. He is a man of few talents.

Monday 2 May 2005 14.00 BST An Italian report into the shooting dead of one of its secret agents by US troops in Iraq is expected to differ sharply with a Pentagon investigation when it is published later today . The US military said its soldiers had followed their rules of engagement but the Italian report will pick apart US conclusions on the incident , the Italian press reported . Secret agent Nicola Calipari was shot dead at a US checkpoint on the approach to Baghdad airport as he shielded Giuliana Sgrena , a hostage whose freedom he had just negotiated , from the gunfire .

Suicide bombing is n't as new or alien as westerners imagine Saturday 14 May 2005 00.01 BST One of the most chilling aspects of the Iraqi conflict is that suicide bombings have now become a matter of everyday routine . During April there were 67 , a new record .

It says Britain 's ability to carry out counter - terrorism measures has also been hampered because the US is always in the driving seat in deciding policy . The report says the security services , diverted by fighting the IRA over Northern Ireland and the rise of animal activists committing terrorist acts , failed to give priority in the early 1990s to monitoring Islamist terror activists setting up in Britain , so ` ` the British authorities did not fully appreciate the threat from al - Qaida '' .

In an interview with the Christian Science Monitor last week, Jordan accused the US military of deliberately targeting journalists. He later apologized, saying he had been "quoting" a journalist who had been killed by a roadside bomb. More than 50 journalists and media workers have been killed in Iraq in the last two years. "I have decided to resign in an effort to prevent CNN from being unfairly tarnished by the controversy over conflicting accounts of my recent remarks regarding the alarming number of journalists killed in Iraq," Jordan said in a memo to staff.']

The MP George Galloway angrily rejected fresh allegations last night from a US senate investigation that he lied under oath about Saddam Hussein 's multimillion - pound oil - for - food program . The inquiry , headed by the Republican Norm Coleman , claimed he had ` ` knowingly made false or misleading statements under oath '' when he appeared before a committee hearing in Washington in May . The MP for Bethnal Green and Bow won widespread acclaim , especially from anti - Iraq war campaigners , when he flew to the US capital to confront Mr Coleman . An assistant to Mr Galloway , Ron McKay , who sat beside him at the Senate hearing , said last night that the MP was prepared to fly to Washington again to face the new allegations . ` ` If such an allegation has been made , George denies it absolutely and is ready to fly to the US tomorrow if Coleman brings these charges and it will all be sorted in court , '' he said . Elaina Morton is not listed as one of the 2,000 Americans now confirmed killed in Iraq since the start of the war , but she might as well be .

Blair 's litany of failures on Iraq - ambassador 's damning verdict Meyer says PM failed to exert any leverage on Bush and was seduced by US power President Bush with Tony Blair in the Blue Room at the White House a few hours before addressing Congress and the nation on September 20 2001 . Sir Christopher , highly critical of Mr Blair 's performance in the run - up to the war , argues the prime minister and his team were ` ` seduced '' by the proximity and glamour of US power and reluctant to negotiate conditions with George Bush for Britain 's support for the war . He says Mr Blair failed to exploit his enormous leverage with Mr Bush not only to secure a precious delay but to plan for postwar Iraq . ` ` We may have been the junior partner in the enterprise but the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go it alone . Had Britain so insisted , Iraq after Saddam might have avoided the violence that may yet prove fatal to the entire enterprise . '' The media are minimizing US and British war crimes in Iraq The reporting of the Iraqi death toll - both in its scale and account of who is doing the killing - is profoundly dishonest We were told that the Iraqis do n't count . Before the invasion began , the head of US central command , General Thomas Franks , boasted that ` ` we do n't do body counts '' . His claim was repeated by Donald Rumsfeld in November 2003 -LRB- ` ` We do n't do body counts on other people '' -RRB- and the Pentagon last January -LRB- Steffen Andersch , who has jumped to his death at the age of 21 , was a singer , guitarist , activist in the fight against fascism in his German homeland and a passionate photographer of the underside of London .

Friday 8 July 2005 15.01 BST During the last phase of the Troubles , the IRA targeted mainland Britain : it came close to blowing up Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet in Brighton .

A forum that often is raucous and rowdy was solemn and grave . A chamber that normally is a bear pit of partisan emotions was united in shock and sorrow .

The group claimed responsibility for the London bombings in a statement released to the media last night. The man's name hasn't been released."]
Of course those who backed the Iraq war refute any link with the London bombs - they are in the deepest denial Monday 11 July 2005 00.03 BST Shortly after September 11 2001 , when the slightest mention of a link between US foreign policy and the terrorist attacks brought accusations of heartless heresy , the then US national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice got to work .

Thursday 17 February 2005 01.49 GMT American soldiers traumatised by fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are to be offered the drug ecstasy to help free them of flashbacks and recurring nightmares . The US food and drug administration has given the go - ahead for the soldiers to be included in an experiment to see if MDMA , the active ingredient in ecstasy , can treat post - traumatic stress disorder . Scientists behind the trial in South Carolina think the feelings of emotional closeness reported by those taking the drug could help the soldiers talk about their experiences to therapists .

A thousand pages of evidence from US army investigations released to the American Civil Liberties Union after a long legal battle , and made available to the Guardian , show that an Iraqi detained at Tikrit in September 2003 was forced to withdraw his report of abuse after soldiers told him he would be held indefinitely . Meanwhile , photographs taken in southern Afghanistan showing US soldiers from the 22nd Infantry Battalion posing in mock executions of blindfolded and bound detainees , were purposely destroyed after the Abu Ghraib scandal to avoid ` ` another public outrage '' , the documents show .

Brown is expected to use the occasion to criticize the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, as well as to announce plans to extend the life of the Iraq war by another three years. Brown is also expected to announce plans to extend the life of the Iraq war by another three years."]
Danger and anti - war stance keep celebrities away Shows now depend on Christian hip - hop groups During world war two American troops away from home for Christmas were entertained by Marlene Dietrich , Bing Crosby and the Marx Brothers .

Even Bob Hope was guaranteed an appearance in Vietnam, but now soldiers in Iraq are more likely to get a show from a Christian hip-hop group, a country singer you have probably never heard of, and two cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys, the Telegraph reports.']

Liberals will blame anybody else for atrocities rather than accuse murderous Islamic terrorists There are plenty of signs that Paris could be next . French intelligence agents found a message on an Arabic website from the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat , a demented Algerian outfit which is close to al - Qaeda . France was ` our first enemy ' , the terrorists said . The ` only way to discipline France is jihad , martyrdom and Islam ' .
['– A French court has ordered the release of three men suspected of being involved in the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris, the Guardian reports. Two of the men, Amedy Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi, were convicted of attempted murder in connection with a 2010 attack on a French satirical newspaper that killed 12. The third man, Amedy Coulibaly, was convicted of attempted murder in connection with a 2011 attack on a kosher market in Paris that killed eight. The court also ordered the release of a fourth man suspected of being involved in the attack, Hamyd Mourad, who has been in custody since January. France\'s interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said today that there is no indication that the attacks were the work of an al-Qaeda-linked group. "There is no indication that this was an act of terrorism by a group linked to al-Qaeda," Cazeneuve said. "France was our first enemy."']
' I was a woman in a warrior 's world ' General Janis Karpinski was commander of Abu Ghraib prison when the abuse scandal erupted . In a memoir out this week she reveals her fury at being made the scapegoat I rarely fell asleep in Baghdad . I would collapse on my bunk , pass out from the heat for a few hours , then drag myself out for a pre - dawn run , while it was still only 27C-32C . Army leaders did not seem to want me to run , but I ran anyway .

['– "I was a woman in a warrior\'s world." That\'s how Janis Karpinski describes her life as a reserve general in Iraq before the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal erupted, in a new memoir. "I would collapse on my bunk, pass out from the heat for a few hours, then drag myself out for a pre-dawn run, while it was still only 27C-32C," she writes. "Army leaders did not seem to want me to run, but I ran anyway." Karpinski, who became commander of Abu Ghraib when the scandal broke, says she was made the scapegoat because she was a woman. "The senior warriors seeing this reserve general, a woman, running at 4.30am decided to do something—or maybe it was just a coincidence that they kept changing the rules," she writes. Karpinski\'s memoir, The Renegade General, is out this week.']

['– Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have declared a cease-fire, reports the New York Times.

The White House pushed back against rising pressure from some U.S. lawmakers for direct intervention in Libya , saying it first wanted to figure out what military options could achieve in this oil - producing desert state which is wracked by conflict .

The move follows a decision by major U.S. oil firms to halt trade with Libya and makes it almost impossible for European firms to buy Libyan oil and supply refineries in countries such as France and Italy . Around half of Libya 's oil output , or more than 1 percent of global supply , has already been choked off by lethal clashes between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . ` ` Banks do n't want to finance the system in Libya , so for the moment no one is getting money for oil .

Saadi Gadhafi said his father was looking for a deal in which he would agree to step down with certain guarantees. "If he steps down, Libya will become a Somalia," said Saadi Gadhafi. "We are talking about Somalia, not Libya." He said his father would step down with the help of the Libyan people, who would then elect a parliament to determine his fate. But there was no official confirmation of the al-Jazeera report. In other developments: German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has called for new UN sanctions against Gadhafi. " Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people," he told a newspaper, according to Reuters. "The flow of money must be cut off."']

The interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro - Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry .

The officials , speaking at a news conference in Tripoli , said that Libya 's liberation -- the signal for the creation of a new government and the start of a democratic transition -- would be announced in the eastern city of Benghazi on Saturday . They confirmed that one of Gaddafi 's sons , Mo ` tassim , had been killed and his body taken to Misrata , west of the city of Sirte where he and his father were captured . The officials said they did not know whether another son , Saif al - Islam , had been killed or captured alive .
['– The capture and death of Moammar Gadhafi has been confirmed by Libya’s interim government, but the whereabouts of his sons are still unknown. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, is believed to be in the desert around the town of Bani Walid, according to a member of the National Transitional Council. He will be captured soon, the council member said, according to al-Jazeera. The Telegraph, however, reports that Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was captured with the bodies of his father and his former security chief, Abdullah Sanussi, and says they are likely to be buried in a mass grave in Sirte. The body of Gadhafi’s youngest son, Seif al-Islam, was also found in the Sirte area, according to al-Jazeera, but his whereabouts are unknown.']

By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent International efforts to bring pressure to bear on President Bashar al - Assad 's regime in Syria have collapsed in acrimony . Disagreements over the resolution have led to acrimony between the two sides The decision by Russia and China to veto an Arab League - inspired resolution at the United Nations Security Council has created serious strains especially between Moscow and the West . Worse , it has probably sent the wrong signal to President Assad , who many analysts believe is determined to step up the violence . The annual Munich Security Conference in Germany has provided a ring - side seat as this diplomatic drama played out . By Barbara Plett BBC UN correspondent The US accused Russia and China of shameful intransigence after the vote The UN resolution supporting an Arab League peace plan was the most determined effort so far by the Security Council to try and respond to the crisis in Syria . It now lies in tatters after the double veto by Russia and China . The scale of the defeat was registered in the gloom on the faces of Western and Arab envoys , and in the bitter exchanges in the council after the vote . Using words like ` ` disgusted '' and ` ` appalled '' , Western diplomats accused Russia and China of holding the council hostage , and of complicity in the policy of repression carried out by the regime of President Bashar al - Assad . The disappointment was all the deeper because this was the second double veto on Syria , and because this time agreement had seemed possible . Syria : UN veto gives Assad licence to kill - opposition The BBC 's Paul Wood and cameraman Fred Scott were smuggled into Homs The Syrian National Council , an opposition umbrella group , urged Moscow and Beijing to change their minds . The veto caused anger among Western diplomats . Activists earlier attacked Syrian embassies across the world . 07 February 12 00:35 GMT As Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov heads to Syria for talks with President Bashar al - Assad , BBC Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford assesses what he might hope to achieve from his visit . Tuesday 's visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the director of Russia 's Foreign Intelligence Service , Mikhail Fradkov , comes three days after the UN Security Council meeting in which Russia and China vetoed a resolution condemning the Syrian government 's violence against its citizens . Sergei Lavrov has not revealed the details of the message he says he is taking to Damascus from his own head of state , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev . Mr Lavrov said that those who ` ` hastily '' brought the resolution to a vote in the Security Council had ignored Russia 's request to wait until he had been to see President Assad . He described comments by American and European leaders after the vote as ` ` indecent and hysterical . '' Protests against the government have continued despite unrelenting attacks by security forces The Russian and Chinese veto of the UN draft resolution on Syria is condemned in the Arab , Turkish , Israeli and even Russian press , finding support only in the official Syrian and Chinese media and pro - government newspapers in Syria 's ally , Iran . Some Arab newspapers criticise UN and Arab League efforts , and support a French proposal to aid the Syrian opposition through an informal international grouping . Syrian and Iranian papers denounce the resolution as a Western ploy and the Arab League as a US ` ` pawn '' . Chinese papers back Beijing 's actions as defense of non - interference in internal affairs . Violence in Syria has continued unabated for nearly a year Chinese state - run media have defended Beijing 's veto of a UN resolution condemning Syria 's crackdown on anti - government protesters .

['– Russia\'s foreign minister is in Syria today for talks with President Bashar al-Assad, after the country\'s double veto of a UN resolution condemning the violence there. Sergei Lavrov will meet with Assad, as well as with Syria\'s foreign minister and the director of Russia\'s Foreign Intelligence Service, the BBC reports. Lavrov slammed the "indecent and hysterical" comments made by US and European leaders after Russia\'s veto, saying they were simply an attempt to drum up international support for a League of Arab States resolution that would have been better suited to Russia and China\'s position.

By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Declaring a civil war could change how the outside world perceives the situation Syria 's deepening conflict has now turned into a full - scale civil war . That 's the verdict of the UN 's Under - Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous . ` ` The government of Syria has lost some large chunks of territory in several cities to the opposition , '' he says , ` ` and wants to retake control of these areas '' . The pragmatic view is that if it looks and sounds like a civil war , then it is one . Sergei Lavrov : ` ` I believe this is counterproductive and quite a dangerous approach '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Western attempts to get Moscow to discuss sanctions against Syria contain ` ` elements of blackmail '' . Mr Lavrov said the West had threatened to end a UN observer mission if Russia opposed its draft resolution .

They said the regime had used helicopters and tanks to repel a well - planned attack . UN chiefs are trying to persuade China and Russia to agree tougher measures . Nawaf Fares : Chemical weapons ` may have been used ' Former Syrian diplomat Nawaf Fares , who defected last week , has said President Bashar al - Assad would not shy away from using chemical weapons on his own people , and has colluded with al - Qaeda to carry out attacks . But how valid are the claims , asks the BBC 's security correspondent Frank Gardner in Doha . Nawaf al - Fares does not look at first glance like a man who has just defected from a regime he calls ` ` murderous criminals '' . Neatly dressed in suit and tie , he was until last week Syria 's ambassador to Iraq and is the most senior diplomat to defect so far from the rule of President Bashar al - Assad . 17 July 2012 Last updated at 13:17 GMT Help Fighting is intensifying across the Syrian capital Damascus , where the military has deployed tanks and helicopters , activists say .

The following is a timeline of key events in the Syrian conflict . Beginning with the start of the uprising in March 2011 , it charts major attacks on government targets as well as the worst cases of killings of civilians . Efforts by the members of the international community to influence and bring an end to the conflict are also mentioned . Demonstrators demanded the release of political prisoners , but some were shot dead by security forces , triggering unrest that gradually spread throughout the country . The Syrian uprising , then a month old , experienced its bloodiest day so far on 22 April when 72 protesters were killed by security forces firing on crowds . By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent The three men were taking part in a meeting of ministers and security heads , state TV said The reported attack in Damascus could mark an important symbolic turning point in the struggle to overthrow President Bashar al - Assad 's regime . The claim that a bomber was able to carry out such an attack against a high security target speaks volumes about the government 's ability to protect its own members and raises questions about the broader capacities of Syria 's ` ` security state '' . Caution , though , is still needed . Details of the event are sketchy , contested , and rely upon elements all with their own axes to grind .

By Jonathan Marcus BBC Defense and Diplomatic Correspondent , in Tunis Syrian opposition protesters clashed with police outside the talks in Tunis Urgency but also frustration marked this inaugural gathering of the Friends of Syria grouping . Urgency because of the worsening situation on the ground - but frustration because even the participants knew than none of the measures discussed at the Tunis meeting are likely to bring about the fall of the regime of Bashar al - Assad anytime soon . Rumour has it that the Saudi Foreign Minister , Prince Saud al - Faisal , walked out early in frustration at the limited ambitions for this meeting . Or did he , as his officials say , have to go to a bilateral meeting ? It is clear the Saudis do feel unhappy with the pace of developments and the kind of consensus - driven diplomacy that dominates these kinds of events . China 's outspoken opposition to international action on Syria is not easy to explain In Tunisia , representatives of 70 nations are trying to find ways to pressure Syria into accepting a ceasefire , to allow humanitarian access , and to show support for Syria 's opposition . But it 's in Beijing and Moscow , far away , where the power to end Syria 's bloodshed really lies . So far China and Russia have provided the diplomatic support that has shielded Syria from international pressure . Some say their actions have emboldened the regime of Bashar al - Assad in Syria to believe it can act with impunity . They are the two major powers that have blocked efforts in the UN Security Council and the Arab League to force Syria to halt its military offensive against its own people .

Syria in civil war , says UN official Herve Ladsous UN 's Sausan Ghosheh on monitors being attacked in Haffa : ` ` We were confronted with angry crowds '' Syria is now in a state of civil war and the government has lost control of ` ` large chunks '' of cities , the UN 's head of peacekeeping has told reporters . It is the first time a UN official has formally voiced that view . His comments came as UN monitors in Syria were fired on as they tried to reach the besieged town of Haffa . Meanwhile , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused Russia of supplying attack helicopters to the Syrian government . By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent For the moment , that does not seem to be the case . Indeed , since the outset of the Syria crisis in March 2011 , there has been little appetite for outside military intervention . This has been based on two assessments . Firstly , that this would be no simple military option : the situation on the ground in Syria is in many ways very different from that in Syria : France calls for UN to enforce Annan plan Smoke was seen rising in Talbisa in Homs province -LRB- picture released by opposition Shaam News Network -RRB- French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius says he will call on the UN Security Council to make mediator Kofi Annan 's Syria peace plan mandatory . France would propose that Mr Annan 's six - point plan be enforced under the UN 's Chapter Seven provision , he said . The BBC 's Middle East bureau editor Paul Danahar recently visited Syria , where he saw a population living in a state of fear and suspicion . Here he explains the dimensions to the conflict and why a solution is proving elusive . The world spent too long looking at the Syrian conflict through the prism of the other Arab uprisings . The regime was just another domino waiting to fall and that is how the world saw the crisis , in black and white . But as the conflict became more complex it dissolved into shades of gray . 13 June 2012 Last updated at 21:40 GMT Help French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said he will call on the UN Security Council to make mediator Kofi Annan 's peace plan fro Syria mandatory . France will propose that Mr Annan 's six - point plan be enforced under the UN 's Chapter Seven provision , he said . Mr Fabius said the conflict in Syria had descended into a ` ` civil war '' . How Russian and Chinese media justify Syrian support As Russia and China remain steadfast in their refusal to back UN resolutions condemning President Bashar al - Assad , the BBC news website looks at media coverage of the Syria conflict in both countries and whether broadcasters tend to justify this stance . Most Russians get their information about the wider world from three dominant TV channels - Rossiya 1 , Channel One and NTV , which are controlled by the state and generally serve the interests of the Kremlin . Russian television suggests that Syria 's government is battling a violent insurgency Between them , these channels get around 50 % of the total TV audience . Their share of the TV news audience is significantly higher . For most of the current crisis in Syria , Russian TV has suggested that President Assad is facing a violent insurgency that has allowed Islamic terrorists and various criminal elements to wreak havoc in the country .
['– Syria is now in a state of civil war, and the government has lost control of "large chunks" of cities, says the UN\'s head of peacekeeping. It\'s the first time a UN official has acknowledged that Syria is in a state of civil war, the BBC reports.

By PJ Crowley Former US Assistant Secretary of State The narratives used were quite familiar : defending the status quo , supporting the aspirations for revolutionary reform and demanding responsible governance in accordance with international norms . But the key players - the United States , Russia and the Arab League - had all traded places . As if in the midst of a game of musical chairs , they were all advancing policy prescriptions markedly different than those held in previous decades , even in previous months . During most of the Cold War the United States was , by and large , the staunch defender of the status quo and supported existing governments regardless of how autocratic , corrupt or unpopular , as long as they sided with the ` ` free '' world . All options were binary . UN Syria text drops call for Assad power handover Thousands have died in more than 10 months of unrest in Syria - mostly unarmed protesters The Russians have argued that this demand would impose regime change . However the new text still supports what it calls the League 's ` ` decision '' to facilitate political transition . Western diplomats say this means that while the draft no longer mentions the details of the Arab plan , it still clearly backs the substance . 03 February 12 17:03 GMT Russia 's deputy foreign minister says his country ` ` can not support '' a draft United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria . According to the Interfax news agency , Gennady Gatilov said that despite changes that took some of its concerns into account , Russia could not support the text in its current form . ` ` This is not enough for us , '' he said . Russia threatens UN veto over Syria resolution Russian UN envoy Vitaly Churkin addressed the council in a closed - door meeting , diplomats say Russia has threatened to veto a UN Security Council resolution on Syria if it is put to a vote on Friday , diplomats say . Russian officials say they need more time to consult Moscow , BBC UN correspondent Barbara Plett reports . Meanwhile , a new draft resolution is to be sent back to governments for further deliberation . The wording has already been watered down in an apparent attempt to overcome Russian objections . The new text drops explicit calls for President Bashar al - Assad to yield powers to a deputy to oversee a political transition . 05 February 12 01:10 GMT Fresh protests have taken place outside the Syrian embassy in London amid reports that at least 55 people were killed by shelling in the country . Twenty two people were arrested on Saturday after crowds had initially gathered during the early hours , with some trying to enter the building . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office condemned the attack on the embassy and said security was being reviewed . Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was ` ` horrified '' at reports from Syria . His comments come as an Arab and Western - backed resolution condemning the violent crackdown in Syria was vetoed at the UN Security Council by Russia and China .
['– With the UN Security Council poised to vote on a Syria resolution tomorrow, Russia has threatened to veto it if it\'s put to a vote, the BBC reports. Russia, along with China, vetoed a similar resolution last month. Russia\'s deputy foreign minister says his country can\'t support the new draft because it doesn\'t call for the immediate departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. "This is not enough for us," Gennady Gatilov said, according to Interfax. China and Russia also vetoed a draft resolution last month condemning the Syrian government\'s bloody crackdown on protesters. In other Syria news: Protests broke out outside Syria\'s embassy in London today, with some trying to enter the building and others hurling Molotov cocktails at it, Sky News reports.

Shashank Joshi of the Royal United Services Institute considers how the military , the foundation of Bashar al - Assad 's rule , is coping . Last year , late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered his army to forcibly crush a burgeoning protest movement . The eastern part of his army melted away immediately , and over eight months the rest progressively disintegrated to leave a rump of loyal , family - led units .

Syrian forces are continuing to attack opposition strongholds in the country . Activists say shelling resumed early on Thursday in the central city of Homs - where the army launched an assault last week .
['– Russia\'s foreign minister is in Syria, where he met with President Bashar al-Assad today and called for an Arab League mission to monitor peace efforts, reports the BBC.

The Baba Amr district has borne the brunt of the government 's crackdown on opposition in Homs The restive western Syrian city of Homs has been one of the areas hardest hit by the state 's bloody crackdown on protests against President Bashar al - Assad . Homs - for many the capital of the Syrian Revolution - was one of the first cities to join the uprisings against the government , and in April 2011 saw its brutality first - hand when crowds protesting in its Clock Tower Square were fired on , reportedly leaving at least 50 dead and others wounded . Protests against the government have continued there , despite equally unrelenting attacks by security forces . Witnesses quoted by the UK - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said hundreds of armored vehicles arrived in the city in early December .

The prayers will test whether President Bashar al-Assad's decision Thursday to lift emergency law, imposed by his Baath Party when it took power in a coup 48 years ago, will defuse mass discontent with repression and corruption. Aided by his family and a pervasive security apparatus, Assad, 45, has absolute power in Syria. More than 220 protesters have been killed since pro-democracy protests erupted on March 18 in the southern city of Deraa, including 21 protesters killed this week in Homs, rights activists say."]

Mexicans still haunted by 1979 Ixtoc spill By Julian Miglierini BBC News , Campeche , Mexico The Ixtoc well was drilling at 150 ft compared with Deepwater Horizon at 5,000 ft If the worried inhabitants of the southern coast of the US wonder what long - term effects the BP oil spill will have on their livelihoods and the environment , they could come to the Mexican state of Campeche to find answers . An explosion in 1979 at the Ixtoc I platform , located 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- off Mexico 's Gulf Coast , caused the largest ever peacetime oil spill . It took Pemex , Mexico 's state - owned oil company , more than nine months to stop the leak , during which time almost 3.3 million barrels of oil had gushed into the sea .

Vital BP oil well test back on course after setback Adm Thad Allen : ` ` When BP is ready , we will start to increase the pressure in the capping stack '' BP has fixed a problem with the cap on the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , which delayed a crucial test . Work on starting the test , which was due to begin on Tuesday , has resumed . The oil giant needs to shut all the valves on the new cap in order to test the well 's integrity . BP faces 7-year offshore drilling ban BP has already accepted its guilt in a separate accident in Texas in 2005 that killed 15 A US Congressional committee has agreed measures that would ban BP from new offshore drilling for seven years . The House committee on natural resources voted in favor of precluding companies with poor safety records from offshore oil exploration permits . The proposed law does not name BP , but would apply to any company that has experienced 10 or more deaths in the last seven years . The April explosion of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers . Gulf spill : BP prepares for key oil well test Adm Thad Allen : ` ` When BP is ready , we will start to increase the pressure in the capping stack '' Oil firm BP is preparing to test the strength of its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , in its latest bid to stop the flow . BP began shutting valves linked to the new cap , but a ` ` small leak '' in a pipe has delayed the tests . The firm said it would take a ` ` short while '' to fix . The tests will find out if the well can handle the pressure of the flow . James Reynolds reports as BP say the oil has stopped leaking BP says it has temporarily stopped oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from its leaking well . It is the first time the flow has stopped since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The well has been sealed with a cap as part of a test of its integrity that could last up to 48 hours . US President Barack Obama said the development was a ` ` positive sign '' but noted that BP was still in the testing phase . President Obama : ` ` This is good news '' ` ` It is important we do n't get ahead of ourselves , '' he said . Incident commander Adm Thad Allen warned a test of the well did not show conclusively there were no other leaks . He said the test would continue for several more hours at least before BP reassesses to see whether the well should be opened again . Meanwhile , Mr Obama said : ` ` One of the problems with having this camera down there is , is that when the oil stops gushing , everybody feels like we 're done - and we 're not . '' President Obama : ` ` This is good news '' BP says it is encouraged by the first test data following its stoppage of the oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well . President Obama gave a cautious welcome but added : ` ` It is important we do n't get ahead of ourselves . '' Pressure within the well is steadily rising , a good sign , said Kent Wells , BP 's vice president . BP shares rose modestly on Friday after the group confirmed it had temporarily stopped oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from its leaking well . At the close of trading , shares were up 1.3 % , having risen as much as 5 % earlier in the day . It is the first time the flow has been stopped since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April . The well has been sealed with a cap as part of a test of its strength that could last up to 48 hours . BP , however , remains cautious about the success of the latest development . Environmental activist Dave Janka shows Rajesh Mirchandani oil from the Valdez still in local waters Before the BP accident in the Gulf of Mexico , America 's worst offshore oil leak was the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . Twenty - one years later , the BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani went to a nearby fishing village to see how its people had recovered - and found not all of them had . Surrounded by jagged snow - covered peaks and perched on the edge of a chilly fjord on Prince William Sound , the small Alaskan fishing town of Cordova is in a beautiful part of the world . But 21 years after one of the worst environmental disasters in US history , it remains scarred . In March 1989 , the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef and spewed 11 m gallons of crude oil into the sound 's pristine waters , and , until April 's BP accident in the Gulf of Mexico , it was America 's worst spill . The well has temporarily stopped leaking oil , but beach clean - up efforts continue BP says there are no signs of leakage from its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , a day after the flow was stopped for the first time since April . No oil has escaped from the new cap sealing the well and there was no sign of any breach under the sea floor , BP executive Kent Wells said . However , more pressure testing is being done to check there are no ruptures . Earlier , the US official overseeing the spill response , Adm Thad Allen , said the latest tests were inconclusive . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface . However , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device . NEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL BP awaits crucial Gulf of Mexico oil well test data Video feeds from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico continue to show no leaking oil Oil firm BP is awaiting test results from the blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico , a day after staunching the flow of oil for the first time since April . The firm is checking how much pressure the well can withstand while the valves on its new capping device are closed . US President Barack Obama hailed the move as a ` ` positive sign '' , and BP 's shares rallied in early trading in London after sharp rises in New York . Hopes are rising for the first time since the blast Tests on BP 's newly capped Gulf of Mexico oil well show pressure has been building up slightly as hoped with no signs of leakage , BP says . BP vice - president Kent Wells said rising pressure ` ` is giving us more and more confidence '' . However , tests have been extended for another 24 hours . The new cap has managed to stop the flow of oil for the first time since a 20 April explosion killed 11 people . Testing of BP 's newly capped Gulf of Mexico oil well has been extended for a further 24 hours . The US official in charge of the spill clean - up , Admiral Thad Allen , said the ` ` integrity test '' would not stop until Sunday afternoon . He added that when the test ceased , containment of the spill using surface ships to collect oil would resume . The new cap has managed to stop the flow of oil for the first time since the well exploded three months ago . The flow of oil was shut off at 1425 local time -LRB- 1925 GMT -RRB- on Thursday .
['– BP says it has stopped oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded more than a month ago. President Obama welcomed the news as a "positive sign," but said it was still in the testing phase and that it was important to "get ahead of ourselves" before jumping to any conclusions, the BBC reports. The company began shutting the valves on a new cap yesterday, but a minor leak delayed the start of a key test to see if the well can handle the pressure of the flow.']

US Adm Thad Allen says oil clean - up ` will take years ' Coast Guard chief Admiral Thad Allen warns oil will not be fully contained for months The US Coast Guard chief says cleaning up marshlands affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill will take years . Adm Thad Allen said oil giant BP needed to do better at getting money to people and businesses affected by the spill . Some 11,000 barrels of oil were being trapped by a containment cap , he said . Thousands have submitted their ideas to BP We asked readers to submit their ideas on how the Gulf of Mexico oil spill should have been stopped . A selection of the hundreds we received has been assessed by Prof Iraj Ershaghi , director of petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California .

BBC Radio 4 's The Report To be present during the early sessions of the Congressional inquiries into the cause of the Deepwater Horizon explosion last month , was to get a sense that this is not a great time to be trading on the word ` ` British '' in Washington . The BP oil spill has cast US energy policy in a new light Congressmen were lining up to heap scorn on both BP 's response to the spill and its prior safety record in the United States . Although BP has not been called British Petroleum for the best part of a decade , it has become fashionable for administration officials and congressmen to refer to it pointedly by its former name . But despite the ill - feeling directed towards Britain 's biggest company , the more resounding lesson to come from the catastrophe could be for the United States and its relationship with its offshore oil industry . BP to make decision on ` top kill ' plan to stem oil leak Underwater video shows tests on the seabed ahead of a plan to plug the leak The oil company BP is to decide on whether to carry out a new plan to try to stem the leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , the chief executive has said . Tony Hayward said the procedure would begin on Wednesday if considered safe . Teams have been carrying out diagnostic tests to ensure the ` ` top kill '' method is feasible and will not backfire .

The ban will stay in place while a commission further investigates the circumstances of the disaster . BP says its latest effort to stem the flow of oil from the well after a rig explosion is going to plan .

Now the slow - moving oil spill threatens Mr. Obama 's reputation , along with 40 % of America 's sensitive wetlands .

By Richard Anderson Business reporter , BBC News BP has suffered a number of controversies in recent years It 's not often that a US president has cause to declare that , given the chance , he would sack the boss of one of the UK 's leading companies . But that is precisely what Barack Obama said he would do on Tuesday , prompted by what he considers to be a series of misjudged comments by BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward following the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . And it 's a view shared by many critics , some of whom are BP shareholders , unimpressed by Mr Hayward declaring that he ` ` just wants his life back '' and that the Gulf is a ` ` big ocean '' . Such comments have simply served to damage further BP 's already battered reputation in the US and fuel anti - BP anger among many Americans , particularly those directly affected by the spill in Louisiana and beyond . By Anthony Reuben Business reporter , BBC News London Mayor Boris Johnson has expressed concern about the ` ` anti - British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America '' . Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today program , he said that he ` ` would like to see a bit of cool heads rather than endlessly buck - passing and name - calling '' . So why is there so much concern about the effect on the British economy ? BP is a huge company , but its shares have almost halved in value since the explosion that set off the spill in the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April . Its stock market value has fallen from about # 125bn to about # 70bn , which may make other oil companies think about making a takeover bid , although shareholders would be unlikely to accept an offer at the current levels . Images of oil - covered birds are fuelling public anger in the US The US government has given BP 72 hours to present its latest plans to clean up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . BP says its containment effort is going well , but there are signs of mistrust between the company and the government . The US justice department is mulling legal action to make sure BP has enough funds to cover the damage and compensate those affected by the slick . That could mean shareholders are not paid dividends , which would infuriate investors and hit pension funds .

UK industry frets about ` ` anti - British '' BP backlash By Russell Hotten Business reporter , BBC News British industry fears that it will all feel the impact from America of this crisis The aggressive rhetoric being used by President Barack Obama towards BP over the oil spillage disaster is making waves across the Atlantic in Britain . In addition to these comments , his officials have begun referring to ` ` British Petroleum '' - a name the company has not used since 1998 . With UK industry increasingly uneasy at what they feel are attempts to label Britain as the villain , the blame game risks turning into a diplomatic row . Sir Christopher Meyer , former British ambassador to the US , told the BBC that the issue had become ` ` a bit of a crisis , politically '' for the American and UK governments .

'' The Telegraph editorial argues that Mr Cameron needs to be firm with Mr Obama when he talks to him this weekend : ` ` In his conversation with the President , Mr Cameron needs to make clear that the long - term financial well - being of BP is crucial to the economies of both Britain and the US . By Reeta Chakrabarti Political correspondent , BBC News David Cameron is facing calls from some newspapers to take action The pressure on David Cameron over the BP oil spill may not be as intense as it is on his American counterpart .

Several newspapers , a former Conservative party chairman , Lord Tebbit , and the present Conservative London mayor , Boris Johnson , are all up in arms at the perceived Britain - bashing by the US president . Headlines such as the Daily Mail 's ` ` Stand Up For Your Country , Mr Cameron '' and its allegations of ` ` cynical '' attacks by Mr Obama on Britain 's ` ` flagship company '' capture the mood in sections of the British press and Tory party . BP directors will meet on Monday to discuss whether to suspend dividends to shareholders , the BBC has learned . Executives will then meet US President Barack Obama on Wednesday , but no announcement on the payments is expected in the near future . BP has been under intense pressure from the US government , which wants BP to use the money to pay for the Gulf of Mexico clean - up . Meanwhile , BP 's shares closed up 7.2 % , recovering losses suffered on Thursday . ` ` No announcement is expected for a while , but it is looking more likely that BP will cease paying the # 1.8 bn of dividends per quarter that it 's been delivering to shareholders - until that

BP 's Doug Suttles explains how the cap is meant to operate A new cap placed over a ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has begun to funnel oil to the surface . US Coast Guard chief Adm Thad Allen said rough estimates showed that 1,000 barrels a day were being captured . This is only a small part of the 12,000 - 19 , 000 barrels a day believed to be leaking and BP says it could take 48 hours to know if the system is working . Meanwhile , President Obama arrived in Louisiana for his third visit to the region since the crisis began . The visit to the Gulf area comes as beaches in the key tourist area of north - west Florida saw their first major signs of oil . Oil firm BP has lowered a cap on to a leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , in the hope of piping some of the oil to ships on the surface . Video footage showed the cap lowered into place against pressure from escaping oil and gas . BP said some oil had started flowing up the pipe attached to the cap , but it could take the rest of the day to determine how much . The US Coast Guard said the cap would only be a temporary , partial fix . Live underwater video footage from the site on Friday showed quantities of oil still escaping into the sea . BP has tried a number of methods to shut down the leak from the damaged oil well - often innovating as subsequent attempts have failed . Although some of the methods have been tried and tested at incidents elsewhere in the world , they have not been carried out at such great depth as the Deepwater Horizon leak - 5,000 feet -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the surface . 2 JUNE : LOWER MARINE RISER PACKAGE After the failure of the top kill procedure , BP attempts to cut the top off the upper section of the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and place a cap on it , sealing the leak and taking oil to a ship on the surface .

At the moment , the only completely accurate answer would appear to be : we do not know . For David Kennedy from the US National Ocean Service , it is ` ` a very very significant event , and of great concern '' . But Clifford Jones , an oil and gas engineering specialist from the UK 's Aberdeen University , suggests it should not be considered in the same category as the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 , with which it is regularly being compared . Inmates could help oil clean - up Criticism of BP is mounting in the US over its handling of the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano urged BP to commit more resources to tackling the catastrophe . Critics of the British oil giant also include President Barack Obama , who is due to travel to the region on Sunday to assess efforts to contain the spill . The sprawling oil slick has begun washing up on the Louisiana coast and is threatening three other states . Up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day are gushing into the sea after the BP - operated Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank last week .
['– The feds are ramping up efforts to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, with the US Coast Guard sending ships to the scene and Florida declaring a state of emergency. Up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking, five times the amount previously thought to be leaking from the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded last week, the BBC reports. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who has declared a state of emergency in four counties along the coast, says the oil slick is "generally moving in a northerly direction and threatens Florida\'s coast." The spill is already threatening three other states.']
BP said there was a ` massive effort ' to control the leak BP has admitted full responsibility for cleaning up the spill . It has refused to accept blame for the accident , however , as the failed equipment that caused the explosion was owned and operated by drilling firm Transocean . By mid - afternoon , BP shares closed down 3 % lower at 558.5 p. Transocean shares also continued to fall , down 3.7 % at $ 70.11 in early trading in New York . Its shares have fallen more than 20 % since the explosion . The dome will be lowered 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- under water to funnel leaking oil to the surface BP has managed to seal the smallest of the three leaks spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico , the company says . Oil is still gushing into the sea at a rate of about 800,000 litres a day , but officials say working with only two leaks makes tackling the spill easier . A controlled burn of the slick to remove oil from open water has also begun , AP news agency said . And a special containment box to funnel oil to the surface from the leaking well is being sent to the site . Engineers plan to lower the 100-tonne concrete and steel box over the site on Thursday , using remote - controlled submarines , officials say . BP 's oil spill funnel plan explained with a tin can Engineers at BP are racing against time to build a funnel to help contain the oil leak into the Gulf of Mexico . The funnel is a 98-tonne , 40-foot iron box that resembles a primitive space rocket . But how will it work ? With the help of a tin can , a fish tank , and Dr Simon Boxall from the University of Southampton , the BBC 's Richard Westcott has been finding out . John Curry , from BP , explains how the funnel should work A giant iron funnel being built in a bid to halt the huge spill from a Gulf of Mexico well will be deployed to the seabed on Thursday , BP says . The 98-tonne , dome - topped box being built by steel workers will be connected to a drill ship and lowered to the sea floor . BP has never deployed such a structure at a depth of 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- and difficulties may occur , it says . ` ` There 's no guarantees , '' BP boss Tony Hayward told AP news agency . Ushahidi is a free , online mapping tool that can be used to collect and plot reports coming in from people via e - mail , SMS and Twitter . It was used in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake to co - ordinate relief . The oil spill map aims to track the long - term impact of the spill on the commercial fishing industry . Most reports are coming from fishermen who can not put to sea because of the oil . One anonymous report reads : ` ` He called himself a pearl diver . Oceanographer Simon Boxall explains how the funnel will work A ship carrying a giant metal containment box has arrived at the site where a sunken oil rig has been leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico . Oil giant BP says it hopes the 90-tonne device will help to contain the oil . The US is to carry out a controlled burn of some of the leaked oil . But the oil reached a beach for the first time on Thursday , officials confirmed . The spill was set off by an explosion that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig off Louisiana last month . Oil spill : US communities watch , uncertain The National Guard have laid two miles of protective boxes along Dauphin Island Along the southern shore of Dauphin Island , troops from the Alabama National Guard splash in the warm shallows of the Gulf of Mexico .

Just how sharply have the estimates changed ? US scientists issued a figure of 35,000 - 60 , 000 barrels -LRB- 1.5 - 2 .5 million gallons -RRB- per day on 15 June . The figure was accepted by US Energy Secretary Steven Chu as ` ` a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil '' . By contrast , an estimate announced by US officials on 26 April put the flow at just 1,000 barrels per day . That figure was later revised to 5,000 barrels . BP shares have closed up almost 7 % after it agreed to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a fund to compensate victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The increase halted falls that had led to the company 's stock value halving in recent weeks . Investors said BP 's agreement with the White House had ` ` removed some of the uncertainty '' surrounding the company . The rise comes despite the announcement that BP shareholders will not receive dividend payments this year . BP CEO Tony Hayward grilled by Congress over oil spill The pressure on BP in the US has continued as the oil company 's beleaguered chief executive , Tony Hayward was given a working over by a US Congressional Committee . He was accused of ` ` astonishing complacency '' and of cutting corners to save money , among a number of other major criticisms and complaints . During the course of the morning , Mr Hayward faced attacks from both politicians and the audience . BP 's oil spill : what has it cost you ? The major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has taken a huge toll on BP 's share value - almost halving it since the spill began in mid - April . In addition , the company has said it will not be paying any dividends to its shareholders this year , after agreeing to finance a $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- clean - up and compensation fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Given that BP is of great importance to the FTSE index of 100 leading companies and the country 's pension funds - what impact will its decline in value and the scrapping of dividends have in practice ? What has happened to my BP shares ? President Obama 's statement about BP 's compensation fund Oil giant BP is to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- in a compensation fund for victims of the Gulf oil spill and will not pay shareholders a dividend this year . Barack Obama announced the compensation deal after talks at the White House with senior BP executives . Shortly afterwards , BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said dividends would not be paid for the rest of this year . The payout fund is to be run by Kenneth Feinberg , a lawyer who oversaw compensation after the 9\/11 attacks . Congress tells Hayward BP ignored oil well dangers During the course of the day , Mr Hayward faced attacks from both politicians and the audience House committee on energy and commerce chairman Henry Waxman said BP 's ` ` complacency '' before the 20 April rig explosion had been ` ` astonishing '' . He accused Mr Hayward of ` ` stonewalling '' for failing to answer his questions . As a public relations exercise for BP , the hearing was a disaster , a BBC correspondent says . David Willis BBC News , Washington Maybe it was President Obama 's decision to dispatch the Attorney General - Eric Holder - to the Gulf Of Mexico a few weeks back to look into the possibility of criminal charges against BP that made the company 's CEO so cautious as he gave testimony .

BP refits Gulf of Mexico oil cap after accident Footage shows the crude oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as Admiral Thad Allen of the US Coast Guard explains how the accident happened BP says it has reinstalled a containment cap on its blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico after an accident unleashed a torrent of oil . BP was forced to remove the cap after an underwater robot bumped into the venting system . Gas had risen through the vent that carried warm water down to prevent ice - like crystals from forming in the cap . The cap has been partially containing the leaking oil and directing some of it to a surface ship . In the Gulf of Mexico , oil continues to hemorrhage from a deep sea well nearly a mile beneath the ocean and about forty miles off the US coast . Although estimates vary , the growing consensus among scientists is that even with the cap that has now been placed over the leak , some 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day of crude oil are continuing to flow into the waters of the Gulf . Latest estimates suggest that some 3 m barrels of oil have already entered the seas since the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk on April 20 . Parts of Caribbean at risk

["– The explosion that killed 11 workers on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was caused by an exploding bubble of methane gas, according to a BP report into the incident. Workers on the rig described hearing screaming and hollering and said people leapt into the sea to escape, the Telegraph reports. Eye witnesses also said safety mechanisms did not function and that workers were taken by surprise. More than 160 miles of protective booms had been deployed. BP is trying to funnel the leaking oil to the surface. A containment device lowered over the well to funnel oil to the surface had to be moved on Saturday after ice—like crystals began accumulating inside it. BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said the 98-ton concrete—and—steel box had to be moved, after ice—like crystals began accumulating inside it. He said BP's engineers hoped they could find a solution to the problem. The aim is to contain as much as 85% of the escaping oil and then funnel it into a waiting tanker on the surface. The latest bid to plug the gushing well comes after previous attempts to stem the flow failed. A growing slick from the BP-leased rig is threatening an environmental disaster along US coasts."]

BP said Transocean 's allegations are misguided and misleading Energy giant BP has been accused of hiding key data needed to investigate the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster . Transocean , the company that owned the oil rig , alleged that BP is refusing to hand over information it needs about the explosion . The claim is made in a letter from one of Transocean 's lawyers sent to members of President Barack Obama 's cabinet . BP rejected the allegation , saying the letter contained ` ` misguided and misleading assertions '' . Nevertheless , the claim risks piling further pressure on BP , which has borne the brunt of political and public criticism for the disaster on 20 April which killed 11 workers and caused the worst oil spill in US history . By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent , BBC News A study of the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill has confirmed the presence of a toxic chemical residue one kilometre below the sea surface . The investigation , carried out in June , shows a plume of crude oil - based chemicals up to 200 m high and 2 km wide , extending 35 km from the spill site . The results are published in the journal Science . There had already been speculation that large quantities of oil from the spill remained dissolved in the sea at depth . This new research confirms that a plume , or cloud , does indeed exist below the surface . BP oil spill : Final Gulf of Mexico well seal delayed Drilling of the relief well was previously delayed because of bad weather An operation to permanently seal the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been delayed until early September , US officials say .

Federal officials say they plan to investigate every possible cause of last week 's massive explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico -- including the possibility of criminal acts or negligence . In the aftermath of the blast , an uncapped underwater oil well continues to leak an estimated 200,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf every day -- creating a monstrous oil slick that made landfall in Louisiana 's wetlands Thursday night and could become the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades . President Obama said Friday that his administration is doing ` ` everything possible '' to respond to the explosion of the BP PLC - operated rig . A top adviser to Obama -- who last month lifted a drilling moratorium for many offshore areas , including the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico -- said no new drilling will be authorized until the cause of the explosion , which killed 11 people , is determined . Obama also ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to report within 30 days on what new technologies will be needed to prevent future oil spills . April 30 : Workers spread oil booms along a railroad trestle that crosses the bay in Bay St. Louis , Miss. , as preparations continue to head off damage from an inpending oil spill along the Gulf coast . AP MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER -- British Petroleum downplayed the possibility of a catastrophic accident at an offshore rig that exploded , causing the worst U.S. spill in decades along the Gulf coast and endangering shoreline habitat . In its 52-page exploration plan and environmental impact analysis for the well , BP suggested it was unlikely , or virtually impossible , for an accident to occur that would lead to a giant crude oil spill and serious damage to beaches , fish , mammals and fisheries . And while the company conceded that a spill would impact beaches , wildlife refuges and wilderness areas , it argued that ` ` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected . '' At least 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled so far , according to Coast Guard estimates . MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER -- Oil from a massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico oozed into Louisiana 's ecologically rich wetlands Friday as storms threatened to frustrate desperate protection efforts . The White House put a hold on any new offshore oil projects until safeguards are in place to prevent rig explosions like the one that caused the spill . Boats patrolled coastal marshes early Friday looking for areas where the oil has flowed in , the Coast Guard said , and the state of Louisiana diverted thousands of gallons of fresh water from the Mississippi River to try to flush out the wetlands , though that effort was being hampered by wind . The National Weather Service predicted winds , high tides and waves through Sunday that could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . Seas of 6 to 7 feet were pushing tides several feet above normal toward the coast , compounded by thunderstorms expected in the area Friday . April 29 : Oil from the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico can be seen as a dark blue swirl advancing toward the Louisiana coast . ESA As oil from the gigantic spill in the Gulf of Mexico reaches U.S. beaches , scientists warn that the potential long - term effects of the massive disaster are hard to gauge -- but potentially disastrous for some local species . The Exxon Valdez disaster is a similar and telling example . May 1 : Ashland Cleaning Services technicians connect oil booms to be deployed in Bay St. Louis , Miss. . AP VENICE , La. -- The surface area of a catastrophic Gulf of Mexico oil spill quickly tripled in size amid growing fears among experts that the slick could become vastly more devastating than it seemed just two days ago . The newly named federal point man for the oil spill said it was impossible to pinpoint how much oil is leaking from a ruptured underwater well . May 1 : Birds fly past oil booms that were placed in preparation of the looming oil spill from last week 's collapse and spill of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig along the shoreline , south of Venice , La. . VENICE , Louisiana -- BP 's chairman defended his company 's safety record and said Sunday that ` ` a failed piece of equipment '' was to blame for a massive oil spill along the Gulf Coast , where President Barack Obama was headed for a firsthand update on the slick creeping toward American shores .

['– Federal officials say they plan to investigate every possible cause of last week\'s massive explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico—including the possibility of criminal acts or negligence. In the aftermath of the blast, an uncapped underwater oil well continues to leak an estimated 200,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf every day—creating a monstrous oil slick that made landfall in Louisiana\'s wetlands Thursday night and could become the nation\'s worst environmental disaster in decades. President Obama said Friday that his administration is doing "everything possible" to respond to the spill, reports the Los Angeles Times. A top adviser to Obama—who last month lifted a drilling moratorium for many offshore areas, including the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico—said no new drilling will be authorized until the cause of the explosion, which killed 11 people, is determined. Obama also ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to report within 30 days on what new technologies will be needed to prevent future oil spills.']

We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused , '' Obama said . ` ` And we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf coast and its people recover from this tragedy .

BP 's Gulf well holds enough oil to spew out for two years , claim experts Figures based on testimony of BP 's Tony Hayward 's suggest huge devastation if Gulf oil spill is not halted Protesters stand behind BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , as he arrives to testify in front of the US Congress .

The estimates , based on new figures supplied by BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , during seven contentious hours of testimony to Congress on Thursday , suggest the potential environmental and economic devastation would far outstrip the damage done so far by the ruptured well , which has been spewing for 60 days . Hayward told a Congressional committee on Thursday the reservoir still held 50 m barrels , providing fresh urgency to efforts to contain the oil , or seal off the gusher completely with a relief well . BP CEO Tony Hayward gives his statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee Photograph : Reuters It was , for Tony Hayward and members of a powerful congressional committee investigating the oil spill catastrophe in the Gulf , a mutually frustrating experience . The much - awaited inquisition of the BP chief executive saw him resort yesterday to the favorite defense of corporate America when hauled up before committees of Congress : ` ` I do n't recall . '' The strategy may have been legally prudent for Hayward , who was testifying under oath , but it did little to salvage the reputation of a man in the running for title of most reviled executive in America . It also wiped out any goodwill which he may have generated by having started off his testimony with an apology . Seven hours after the executive first walked into the wood - panelled room , the most significant admission the committee could wring out was that , maybe , someone at BP should have realized the drilling of the well was going horribly wrong .

"The long battle is finally close to coming to an end, and we are very pleased with that," said President Obama, who declared an end to the spill earlier today. The company said heavy mud was removed from the well as part of the operation. The final step is to pump mud into the well to seal it permanently, a procedure known as a "top kill," but it was delayed yesterday by a minor leak in a control panel, the Guardian reports.']

Does BP 's now - familiar yellow - and - green sunflower logo need an update ? Joe Daley thinks so . As the founder of a website that acts as a clearinghouse for logo designers around the world , Daley reckons the British oil giant 's corporate icon should reflect the spreading oil spi ll in the Gulf of Mexico . So Daley 's launched an online contest to find an appropriate replacement logo . These kinds of logo competitions are nothing new ; that 's how the website works to match designers with businesses , with the businesses paying the prize to the winning design . President Barack Obama , struggling to get on top of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , vowed an overhaul of U.S. laws and regulations needed to prevent a repeat of the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 people and triggered the spill . A mile below the ocean surface , BP began a new strategy to tackle the six - week - old drama , using underwater robots to cut away extraneous pipes before trying to contain the leaking oil and channel it to a ship on the surface . After meeting co - chairs of a commission that will investigate the accident , Obama raised the prospect of criminal prosecutions . ` ` If our laws were broken leading to this death and destruction , my solemn pledge is that we will bring those responsible to justice on behalf of the victims of this catastrophe and the people of the Gulf region , '' Obama said .

HOUSTON | Thu Jun 10 , 2010 7:51 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. government scientists on Thursday doubled their estimate of the amount of oil gushing out of a ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well as British energy giant BP scrambled to stem the leak . The news that the flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- per day came after U.S. markets closed . The catastrophic blowout at Macondo has sliced 40 percent off BP 's market capitalization , and led analysts to speculate about lasting reductions in deepwater drilling and the resulting impact on both long - term oil supply and the fate of climate change legislation . The underlying fear is that Macondo is the oil industry 's Three Mile Island , an accident that turned public opinion against nuclear power for three decades . Investors are right to fear the long - term impact on the company . But they exaggerate the impact on the wider industry and the prospects for climate change legislation . BP however faces a very changed operating environment in future . - Kees Willemse is professor of off - shore engineering , Delft University . The opinions expressed are his own . - The news that a huge metal cap has been successfully placed over several of the leaking oil vents at the Deepwater Horizon site marks a potential turning point in the Gulf of Mexico crisis . It is already estimated that each day some 10 - 15 , 000 barrels of the oil that are spilling out into the ocean are being captured and diverted to ships on the sea surface . Despite this engineering success , a complete end to the oil leakage is unlikely until new relief oil wells are completed -- a drilling process that could take most of the summer , and potentially into the autumn . LONDON\/VENICE , Louisiana | Fri Jun 11 , 2010 6:27 pm EDT LONDON\/VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain stuck up for beleaguered BP Plc on Friday against American criticism over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , while the company ramped up efforts to siphon more crude from its gushing well . British Prime Minister David Cameron and his finance minister George Osborne stressed the London - based company was economically important to both Britain and the United States .

NEW YORK | Tue Jul 6 , 2010 5:28 am EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Obama administration may succeed in pushing through its offshore drilling ban , despite fierce resistance from the oil industry , since a piece of machinery in short supply has left oil companies and the environment glaringly vulnerable to another oil spill . The offshore skimming devices -- seagoing vessels that suck up spilled crude -- are the first line of defense in the contingency plans that big oil companies are required to submit when they drill in the deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico . Kimberly Kindy has an excellent and very sobering report on the monstrous discrepancies between the various numbers being bandied around when it comes to the amount of oil that BP is able to skim off the Gulf of Mexico every day . As commenter hsvkitty points out , BP only got the permits to start drilling at the Deepwater Horizon site in the first place because the Minerals Management Service believed their statement that they could recover 197 percent of the daily discharge from an uncontrolled blowout of 250,000 barrels per day : a March report from BP said that it had the capacity to skim and remove 491,721 barrels of oil per day . Even after the explosion , BP was still insisting that it had ` ` skimming capacity of more than 171,000 barrels per day , with more available if needed . '' So far , it has managed to skim less than 900 barrels per day . Add burn - offs , and you get to just over 300,000 barrels in total , over 77 days -- The British Petroleum logo is seen near a petrol station in Dubai with the Burj Khalifa tower in the background July 7 , 2010 .

BP 's vast and spreading oil disaster is killing ever more birds and other wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico -- but one of the worst spills for birds was a harmless - sounding 5 tonnes of oil in the Baltic Sea in 1976 . That spill from a ship killed more than 60,000 long - tailed ducks wintering in the area after they fatally mistook the slick for an attractive patch of calm water , according to Arne Jernelov , of the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm , writing in today 's edition of the journal Nature . By contrast , he writes that fewer than 1,200 birds have so far been recorded killed after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which has led to a leak of a gigantic 250,000 to 400,000 tonnes of oil in the Gulf of Mexico . About 60,000 birds were killed off Alaska in 1989 by the accident usually known as the Exxon Valdez spill -LRB- ... Exxon 's website calls it The Valdez Oil Spill -RRB- , previously the biggest spill off the United States at 37,000 tonnes . BP dampens hope of early leak fix , court fight looms WASHINGTON | Thu Jul 8 , 2010 6:09 pm IST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP dampened hopes that it could plug its leaking Gulf of Mexico well sooner than forecast on Thursday , while a battle between the U.S. government and the oil industry over a deepwater drilling ban heads to court . BP stuck to its August target to complete a relief well to halt the worst oil spill in U.S. history , after a press report raised hopes the company could stem the 80-day - old leak sooner . The head of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration unit , Bob Dudley , told the Wall Street Journal that it could be possible to stop the well between July 20 and July 27 ` ` in a perfect world with no interruptions '' . BP aims to fix leaking oil well by July 27 : report Thu Jul 8 , 2010 1:29 am EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Besieged energy giant BP Plc aims to fix its leaking Gulf oil well by July 27 , ahead of its earlier target of mid - August , to show investors it has limited its burgeoning oil spill liabilities , the Wall Street Journal said , citing company officials . The July 27 target date is the day the company is due to report second - quarter earnings and will speak to investors , the Journal said . ` ` In a perfect world with no interruptions , it is possible to be ready to stop the well between July 20 and July 27 , '' the head of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration unit Bob Dudley told the newspaper in an interview .
['– BP\'s latest plan to plug the gushing oil well is to pump mud into it, a strategy that has so far only succeeded in sucking about 900 barrels of oil a day from the Gulf of Mexico. That\'s less than half of what the company had hoped to suck up in a day, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing the head of BP\'s Gulf Coast restoration unit. The plan to pump mud into the well is a "worst-case scenario" one that will take at least a day, the head of BP\'s operations in the Gulf tells the New York Times. "We\'re not going to be able to stop the flow of oil on our own," he says. "We\'re going to have to deal with the uncontrolled flow of oil. We\'re not going to be able to do that."']

WASHINGTON\/VENICE , Louisiana | Sat May 22 , 2010 7:50 pm EDT WASHINGTON\/VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama on Saturday blamed the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill on ` ` a breakdown of responsibility '' at energy giant BP Plc as he unveiled a commission to investigate the disaster . Obama , in his weekly radio and Internet address , also said offshore oil drilling could only go forward if there were assurances that such accidents would not happen again . While ramping up pressure on companies linked to the still uncapped spill -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd -- he said he would also hold Washington accountable for mending its ways . ` ` First and foremost , what led to this disaster was a breakdown of responsibility on the part of BP and perhaps others , including Transocean and Halliburton , '' Obama said in his toughest remarks yet on companies linked to the spill .

The accident at the offshore oil rig is threatening an ecological and economic calamity along the U.S. Gulf Coast . As BP pushed forward with its tricky undersea effort to redirect the flow of oil after another setback , two members of President Barack Obama 's Cabinet demanded that BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward explain in detail the company 's commitment to pay for damage caused by the enormous spill . ` ` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a letter to Hayward . ` ` Therefore , in the event that our understanding is inaccurate , we request immediate public clarification of BP 's true intentions , '' they added .

But reports of huge oil plumes in the Gulf -- including one as large as 10 miles long , three miles wide and 300 feet thick -- underscored the spill 's environmental impact as the crisis moved into its 24th day . Crude oil has been gushing unchecked from a ruptured well about a mile under the ocean 's surface , threatening an ecological and economic calamity along the U.S. Gulf Coast . After other attempts to contain the spill failed , BP Plc succeeded in inserting a tube into the leaking well and capturing some oil and gas . The underwater operation used guided robots to insert a small tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-cm -RRB- pipe , known as a riser , to funnel the oil to a ship at the surface .

The much - anticipated showdown Wednesday at the White House between President Obama and top BP executives turned into no - nonsense business meeting in which the oil giant agreed to pay $ 20 billion into an escrow account to cover claims associated with the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . There were also apologies from BP 's chairman of the board , Carl - Henric Svanberg -- to the president in the Roosevelt Room , and then to the American people when Svanberg and his grim - faced fellow executives went before the cameras in the White House driveway . Both sides got what they wanted out of the encounter . The administration , under fire for how it has responded to the environmental calamity , can boast of creating a huge pot of money for easing the pain of Gulf Coast residents . BP , though poorer on paper in the short run , got some much - needed clarity on its long - term liability , plus an explicit statement from Obama that the administration does n't want to see BP driven into bankruptcy . Leeville , La. , tries to weather the BP oil spill The town of Leeville , La. , is home to only a handful of people whose lives are twined with the fishing and oil industries . With storm surges swallowing more land every year , Leeville has always been on the verge of disappearing . When fishing waters were closed due to the Deepwater Horizon leak , Leeville 's fate was hastened : The fishermen have fled and businesses are suffering . Tony Hayward video : BP CEO ` deeply sorry ' for oil spill BP CEO Tony Hayward expresses regret during his opening remarks to the House Energy Committee on Thursday . -LRB- AP -RRB- -LCB- ` ` title '' : ` ` Playing the oil prices money game '' , ` ` description '' : ` ` Investors , not oil companies , make up about two thirds of all the oil being traded and are being blamed for skyrocketing oil prices . But investors say they are responding to prices , not driving them . Elected officials should consider imposing ethics rules on oil and gas companies that do business with the federal government , the Interior Department 's acting inspector general plans to tell the House Natural Resources Committee on Thursday . Mary L. Kendall will also tell the panel that the Minerals Management Agency , which oversees offshore oil drilling , is probing the BP oil spill in a ` ` completely backwards '' way and needs to have its culture revamped . The Washington Post obtained a copy of Kendall 's prepared testimony late Wednesday . ` ` While there is ample opportunity to improve and strengthen the regulations that govern MMS and the industry that extracts valuable resources from federal lands , the greatest challenge in reorganizing and reforming MMS lies with the culture -- both within MMS and within industry , '' Kendall intends to tell lawmakers . The agency 's inspectors are not only underpaid and inadequately trained but are also faced with having to oversee too many rigs , she says in her prepared testimony . GOP leaders forced Rep. Barton to retract apology to BP By Aaron Blake and Paul Kane Thursday , June 17 , 2010 ; 5:11 PM Under pressure from Republican leaders who threatened to remove him from a ranking committee position , Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R - Tex . -RRB- late Thursday retracted his apology to BP CEO Tony Hayward for the way his company has been treated by the U.S. government -- a comment that had drawn heavy criticism from both parties . Barton made that apology to Hayward in his opening statement Thursday morning before Hayward 's testimony to the House subcommittee , in which Barton decried the Obama administration for pressuring BP to open a $ 20 billion escrow account and to suspend dividend payments for the rest of the year . The ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said such arrangements have no legal basis , and that the political pressure exerted on the corporation in the midst of an investigation is a ` ` tragedy of the first proportion . '' BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg attempted an earnest apology Wednesday for the worst environmental accident ever to befall America , but it will be remembered for only two words : Svanberg came with other BP executives to the White House , where he said President Obama made clear that he is ` ` frustrated because he cares about the small people . '' ` ` And we care about the small people , '' added Svanberg , who is Swedish . ` ` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care . But that is not the case indeed . We care about the small people . '' LEEVILLE , LA . -- Their eyes are bloodshot . Their scraggy skin glows reddish - brown . They clutch cans of beer . On the wooden deck of Griffin 's Marina and Ice , they recoil when approached , like a nest of vipers . Even after BP oil spill , fundraising events were hopping Lobbyists for BP hosted at least 53 fundraising parties for lawmakers and candidates in recent years -- four of them since the explosion and oil spill at a BP - run oil drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico , according to a watchdog group 's analysis . Lobbyists typically represent multiple clients , and it is unknown how many of the events were intended to advance BP 's interests . The numbers are based on fundraiser data compiled by the Sunlight Foundation , which collects information from anonymous donors and lobbyist reports . The list is incomplete , and it is possible the lobbyists held other fundraisers as well . The much - anticipated congressional hearing Thursday on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill came down to a single word : Sorry . In a room packed with cameras and spectators , BP chief executive Tony Hayward said , ` ` I am deeply sorry '' for the lost lives and environmental damage from his company 's doomed offshore rig . But the British businessman 's apology before the House Energy and Commerce Committee was upstaged by another one . Rep. Joe Barton -LRB- R - Tex . It is not easy to divvy up $ 20 billion . Perhaps no one in America knows this better than Kenneth R. Feinberg . The nation 's unofficial authority on disbursing massive relief funds oversaw the paying out of billions of dollars for families of those who died in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and the Virginia Tech shootings . His phone rang once again this month , not long before word began to spread in Washington about such a fund for victims of the gulf oil spill . BP executives contacted Feinberg to see whether he would be willing to take the job . Adm. Thad Allen , left , and NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco release rehabilitated sea turtles off Cedar Key , Fla. , last week . -LRB- Phil Sandlin\/associated Press -RRB- When I was a junior officer fresh out of the Coast Guard Academy in 1971 , a crusty old warrant officer told me that an idea of mine was in the ` ` too hard to '' do locker . The implication was that some problems are unsolvable and thus get banished to innovation purgatory .
["– BP CEO Tony Hayward appeared before a House panel today for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon exploded, and took the opportunity to apologize to the American people. “I am deeply sorry for what has happened,” he said, adding that he was “deeply sorry” for the damage the spill has done to the Gulf region. “I want to express my sincere apology to the people of the Gulf.” He also took the opportunity to apologize to BP workers who were killed in the accident, and to the people of the Gulf state of Louisiana, where the spill has already soiled an area the size of Delaware. (Click here for more on BP's mea culpas and here for more on today's hearings.) Rep. Joe Barton, the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was forced to retract his apology to BP after pressure from Republican leaders, the Washington Post reports. “I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or don't care,” said BP chairman Henric Svanberg. “But that is not the case indeed. We care about the small people.”"]
Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions . The most critical moment in the oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico is at hand , as BP engineers armed with 50,000 barrels of dense mud and a fleet of robotic submarines are poised to attempt a ` ` top kill '' maneuver to plug the gushing well a mile below the surface . It 's far from a sure bet . ` ` It has been done successfully in the past , but it has n't been done at this depth , '' Kent Wells , the oil company 's senior vice president of exploration and production , told reporters in a conference call Tuesday . This will be the first stab at shutting down the well since the April 20 blowout and fire that killed 11 workers on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon . BP 's oil spillcam : A horror movie about the gulf that 's deeply compelling For all the gunk on television , it 's hard to think of a more depressing show these days than the ` ` spillcam , '' the live , continuous underwater footage of the broken BP pipe that has been gushing away deep , deep down in the Gulf of Mexico for more than a month now .

There is no sound and nothing happens , except the inexorable , unending flow . Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions . BP 's internal investigation of the Gulf Coast oil spill points to a series of equipment failures , mistakes and missed warning signs that led to the blowout and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , according to lawmakers briefed by the company . BP 's investigation , while incomplete , highlights a series of abnormal indicators -- about pipeline pressure and the flow of drilling fluids in the five hours before the explosion -- that should have been ` ` warning signs '' of trouble , according to a memo summarizing BP 's report . In one case , BP 's investigator told lawmakers that a ` ` fundamental mistake may have been made despite '' an indicator of a very large abnormality . BP also said it had concerns about the cementing job in the well , saying that one procedure had to be attempted nine times , which might have indicated ` ` contamination of the cement . '' Wednesday , May 26 , 2010 ; 7:59 PM BP 's head of safety and operations Mark Bly and other company officials gave reporters a technical briefing Wednesday on what BP 's internal investigation of the accident had learned so far , pointing to a cascade of breakdowns and mistakes . New details included : -- BP 's chief representative was ` ` present '' on the rig during a discussion of an abnormal increase in pressure in the drill pipe , an indication that gas was probably in the pipe when it should n't have been . That representative never called the Houston office for advice , despite the indications of trouble and differences between him and the top Transocean person there . -- People on the rig should have known there was oil or gas in the drill pipe because when they were replacing drilling mud with seawater they only needed 352 barrels instead of 775 barrels . -- Pressure logs that were sent to BP 's Houston office via Halliburton suggested that rig workers tried to close valves on the blowout preventer at least twice in the final 18 minutes before the explosion that sank the rig . The ` ` top kill '' is underway , success uncertain . BP engineers are pumping mud at a furious rate into the damaged blowout preventer that sits on the uncapped well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . The hazardous - but - high - reward maneuver comes five weeks into the oil spill crisis amid an intensifying atmosphere of political recrimination that has spread from the Gulf Coast to the White House and Congress . The early bulletins on the top kill were encouraging . ` ` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' BP chief executive Tony Hayward said Wednesday evening , adding that it would be 24 hours before BP knows if the well is dead . Thursday , May 27 , 2010 ; 4:21 PM Scientists have found evidence of a large underwater ` ` plume '' of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , adding to fears that much of the BP oil spill 's impact is hidden beneath the surface . The scientists , aboard a University of South Florida research vessel , found an area of dissolved oil that is about six miles wide , and extends from the surface down to a depth of about 3,200 feet , said Professor David Hollander . Hollander said that he believed the plume might have stretched more than 20 miles from the site of a leak on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , where the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank April 22 . It has not yet reached Florida . The plume is clear , with the oil entirely dissolved .

Gulf oil spill offers a lesson in capitalism vs. socialism A sign marks the closed beach on Elmer 's Island in Grand Isle , La. -LRB- Gerald Herbert\/associated Press -RRB- So who is in charge of stopping the oil spill , BP or the federal government ? With mud continuing to battle oil in an attempted ` ` top kill '' of the leaking well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , the historic scale of the disaster became clearer Thursday when scientists said the mile - deep well has been spewing 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil a day , far more than previously estimated . The new figure supports what many observers have assumed from the images of oil slicking the gulf surface , slathering beaches and spurting from a pipe on the sea floor : This is the worst oil spill in U.S. history . President Obama , feeling pressure to act in a crisis now in its sixth week , yanked the exploratory drilling permits for 33 deepwater rigs in the gulf and suspended planned exploration in two areas off the coast of Alaska . He announced the moves at a news conference carried on cable TV channels that simultaneously showed the live video feed of effluent billowing from the cracked riser pipe at the bottom of the gulf . Obama pushed back on suggestions that , as he put it , ` ` BP is off running around doing whatever it wants and nobody is minding the store . '' La. scientist locates another vast oil plume in the gulf Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions . Friday , May 28 , 2010 ; 4:37 PM A day after scientists reported finding a huge ` ` plume '' of oil extending miles east of the leaking BP well , on Friday a Louisiana scientist said his crew had located another vast plume of oily globs , miles in the opposite direction . James H. Cowan Jr. , a professor at Louisiana State University , said his crew on Wednesday found a plume of oil in a section of the gulf 75 miles northwest of the source of the leak . Cowan said that his crew sent a remotely controlled submarine into the water , and found it full of oily globules , from the size of a thumbnail to the size of a golf ball .
['– BP\'s "top kill" operation is under way, and the company\'s chief executive says it will be 24 hours before they know whether it worked, reports the Los Angeles Times. The live operation involves pumping mud into the gushing well, but it\'s not clear whether it will do the trick. The best-case scenario is that it works, but it\'s not clear whether that will be enough to stop the oil, notes the New York Times. It\'s "far from a sure bet," says the newspaper\'s graphics team, which predicts that it will take at least a day to know for sure. Click here for more on the operation.']
Four weeks after the nation 's worst environmental disaster , the Obama administration saw no need to accept offers of state - of - the - art skimmers , miles of boom or technical assistance from nations around the globe with experience fighting oil spills . In the past week , the United States submitted its second request to the European Union for any specialized equipment to contain the oil now seeping onto the Gulf of Mexico 's marshes and beaches , and it accepted Canada 's offer of 9,842 feet of boom . The government is soliciting additional boom and skimmers from nearly two dozen countries and international organizations . In late May , the administration accepted Mexico 's offer of two skimmers and 13,779 feet of boom ; a Dutch offer of three sets of Koseq sweeping arms , which attach to the sides of ships and gather oil ; and eight skimming systems offered by Norway . ` ` As we understand what we need and identify domestic and foreign sources , we will act , '' said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley , who said the United States has received 21 aid offers from 17 countries and four international groups . In the Gulf of Mexico , plumes of black oil are gushing into the ocean , coating the wings of seabirds , poisoning shellfish , sending tar balls rolling onto white Florida beaches . It is an ecological disaster . It is a economic nightmare . And there is absolutely nothing that the American president can do about it . Here is the hard truth : The U.S. government does not possess a secret method for capping oil leaks . Yes , the BP oil spill is Obama s Katrina In the Gulf of Mexico , howling winds gathered and swooped down on the coast , ruining homes , destroying levees and flooding the city of New Orleans . It was an ecological disaster . It was an economic nightmare . And there was absolutely nothing the the American president could do about it . To save time and drilling costs , BP took ` ` shortcuts '' that may have led to the oil rig explosion and the spill in the Gulf of Mexico , according to a letter released Monday by two House Democrats leading an investigation of the disaster . The letter , sent in advance of congressional hearings with senior oil executives this week , paints a damning picture of five decisions the lawmakers said the oil firm took ` ` to speed finishing the well , '' which was running ` ` significantly behind schedule . '' Marshaling e - mails , interviews and documents , the lawmakers said : ` ` In effect , it appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time , and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk . '' In one instance , four days before the April 20 explosion , Brett Cocales , one of BP 's operations drilling engineers , sent an e - mail to a colleague noting that engineers had not taken all the usual steps to center the steel pipe in the drill hole , a standard procedure designed to ensure that the pipe would be properly cemented in place . '' -LRB- W -RRB- ho cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine and Tuesday , June 15 , 2010 ; 9:30 PM The official estimate of the flow rate from the leaking gulf oil well has surged again , with government officials announcing Tuesday that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million to 2.52 million gallons -RRB- of oil a day are now gushing from the reservoir deep beneath the gulf . The dramatic increase in the estimated flow rate raises the question of whether BP and the government were fully prepared to cope with the hydrocarbons spewing up through the gulf floor . Currently BP has the capacity to capture only 18,000 barrels of day coming from the well . A second method of tapping the well , one that will add up to 10,000 barrels of capacity , will take oil and gas through the ` ` choke '' line on the blowout preventer that was used in the ` ` top kill '' operation last month .

This summary of investigations and legislative action prompted by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico omitted one bill . A measure approved by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee would remove oil companies ' $ 75 million liability limit and retroactively remove the liability cap for BP and the Deepwater Horizon explosion . The summary also misidentified the CLEAR Act that is related to the spill : The legislation in question is the Consolidated Land , Energy and Aquatic Resources Act , not the Carbon Limits and Energy for America 's Renewal Act , which is an unrelated measure . The text below has been modified to reflect these changes . Digging deep after the oil spill Update July 13 at 2:50 p.m. . Oil execs in Senate hearing as gulf oil spill cleanup efforts continue -- photos Oil companies stress one another 's failures in a Senate hearing as cleanup and containment efforts continue in the Gulf of Mexico , after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig April 20 . The presidential commission appointed to study the causes of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and to recommend improvements for offshore drilling has navigated tight spots as it prepares to begin work this week . Unlike the commissions that investigated space - shuttle accidents and the Three Mile Island nuclear incident , the Deepwater panel must analyze what went wrong while things still are going wrong . That real - time analysis of a catastrophe ` ` makes this commission pretty unusual , '' said Amy Zegart , an associate professor at UCLA 's School of Public Affairs who has studied the more than 600 presidential commissions convened in the past two decades . The seven - member commission , which holds hearings Monday and Tuesday in New Orleans , also must find its role amid eight other investigations -- and a Justice Department probe -- into the April 20 explosion that killed 11 and sent oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico . For environmentalists , the BP oil spill may be disproving the maxim that great tragedies produce great change . Traditionally , American environmentalism wins its biggest victories after some important piece of American environment is poisoned , exterminated or set on fire . An oil spill and a burning river in 1969 led to new anti - pollution laws in the 1970s . The Exxon Valdez disaster helped create an Earth Day revival in 1990 and sparked a landmark clean - air law . But this year , the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- and , before that , the worst coal - mining disaster in 40 years -- have n't put the same kind of drive into the debate over climate change and fossil - fuel energy . In a complicated subsea dance involving robots and hardware , BP made progress Sunday in its effort to install a new , secure cap on the gushing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , but the company says that it is early in the week - long project and that the oil is spewing as skimmers try to capture the newly vigorous flow of crude . BP engineers are hopeful that by week 's end they will have placed a perfect seal over the well , which began bleeding oil into the gulf April 20 after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , in which 11 workers died . ` ` We did an extensive amount of preparation work in terms of planning and installation , and we 're pleased at this point on how it 's going , '' said Kent Wells , a BP senior vice president , referring to the removal early Sunday morning of the top flange on the leaking well and the installation of a device that will eventually connect the new cap to the well . Wells said the maneuvers , which are being conducted in large part by robotic submarines a mile under the water 's surface , are going smoothly partly because of a window of good weather and calm seas . Separately , the Sunday Times of London reported that BP is in talks to sell about $ 10 billion in assets , including a share of its Alaska oil production , to Apache , a large U.S. independent oil company .

Here was a river , they will say . The fate of the gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well , and of deep - water oil drilling in general , remained very much unresolved Monday , even as BP engineers finally installed a massive new sealing cap that could potentially enable them to shut down the well permanently . The drama in the depths off the coast of Louisiana unfolded as , in Washington , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued a new moratorium on offshore drilling , trying a new tack to get around an injunction issued recently by a New Orleans federal judge . Instead of banning offshore drilling based on water depth , he barred drilling by the types of rigs and equipment used in deep water . An Interior Department spokesman said that none of the 33 rigs whose work was interrupted in May would be able to resume their activity . ` ` I am basing my decision on evidence that grows every day of the industry 's inability in the deep water to contain a catastrophic blowout , respond to an oil spill and to operate safely , '' Salazar said . The ` ` integrity test '' that could potentially shut down the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher has been delayed until at least Wednesday , a setback in the effort to put an end to what has been called the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . BP had vowed to conduct the test , which would involve closing valves on the leaking well 's newly placed cap , by midday Tuesday . As the day wore on , however , the well continued to billow black oil into the gulf . Late Tuesday evening , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad The story of the last cataclysmic American oil spill has evolved over time into a straightforward tale of cause and effect : In 1989 , a hard - drinking skipper ran his tanker aground in Alaska , and Exxon was unable to prevent crude from spreading along hundreds of miles of pristine shoreline . But the full story of the Exxon Valdez wreck is far more complex , and it offers striking parallels to today 's events in the Gulf of Mexico -- including a central role played by a consortium led by British Petroleum , now known as BP . A commission that investigated the Alaska spill found that oil companies cut corners to maximize profits . Systems intended to prevent disaster failed , and no backups were in place . Regulators were too close to the oil industry and approved woefully inadequate accident response and cleanup plans .
['– BP\'s latest attempt to contain the oil in the Gulf of Mexico is going so well, the company says it\'s on track to have the device in place as early as tomorrow, reports the Times-Picayune. "We\'re pleased at this point on how it\'s going, and we\'re pleased at this point on how it\'s going,\'\' says a BP VP. But it\'s early in the week, and it will be at least a week before the device can be hooked up to the top of the well, which is about a mile below the surface. Click here for more on the progress.']

Though any discussion of potential winners and losers may come a bit early , the sense of hopelessness along the Gulf Coast is easing -- and Washington loves talking about who 's up and down . So with an appreciative nod to The Fix , let 's take a preliminary look at the agencies and officials winning and losing amid the government 's response to the disaster . GRAND ISLE , LA . -- SpongeBob SquarePants and his friends in Bikini Bottom have a message for the BP contractors , cleanup crews and news media that have descended on this small beach town where oil washes up almost daily . ` ` Seriously ... When Can We GO BACK IN THE WATER ? '' In the altered version of the photo , three of the screens show different images than in the original . John Aravosis of Americablog.com pointed out alterations , including jagged white edges around the silhouettes of the photo 's subjects . -LRB- BP p.l.c . -RRB- Scott Dean , a spokesman for BP , said that there was nothing sinister in the photo alteration and provided this original unaltered version . New problems arose in the struggle to contain the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as bubbles and seepage appeared in four areas around the damaged BP well , but Obama administration and company officials agreed to keep the new well cap closed for at least 24 more hours as they weigh the gravity of the developments . Meanwhile , at a hearing in Louisiana , attorneys for crew members of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig did battle with one another and members of a government panel investigating the April 20 explosion while revealing new details about fateful choices made hours before the blowout . In Washington , the Interior Department moved to defuse tensions with shallow - water drilling firms and Gulf Coast lawmakers over how to speed up the permit process . BP said that one of the seepage areas , less than two miles from the Macondo well , is a natural leak not linked to the well . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , Wednesday , July 21 , 2010 ; 8:54 PM The search for doctored BP photos is on . And it 's a bit like finding Waldo in the famous game . The Gawker Web site said it received a tip about a BP photo taken from inside a helicopter , that shows a panorama of vessels working on the sea surface near the damaged well . The view through the windows makes it appear as though the helicopter is in the air . But the astute tipster noticed a small glimpse of a control tower in a corner of the photograph .

Ironically , he went to a training program on blowout preventers . Ronald Sepulvado , who had been working on the Deepwater Horizon for more than seven years , turned off his cellphone after he landed , stopped checking e - mail regularly and did not read an April 18 warning from contractor Halliburton that the well faced a potentially severe gas flow problem . The next news he received about the rig came in the wee hours of April 21 , when his son called him at a hotel and asked if he knew that the Deepwater Horizon was burning . Wednesday , July 21 , 2010 ; 6:43 PM Four oil giants are going to spend $ 1 billion to jointly design , manufacture and store equipment to respond to an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , part of an effort to bolster their capabilities in the wake of the BP disaster and to reassure Congress members worried about future drilling . Exxon Mobil will lead the engineering and construction efforts , which the companies said they hoped to complete in 18 months . The new response plan focuses on how to quickly stop the flow of oil from a leaking subsea well and how to channel the oil to vessels nearby . It does not include new measures for how to skim oil from water or to clean soiled shorelines .

The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the latest of several recent disastrous events for which the country , or the world , was unprepared . Setting aside terrorist attacks , where the element of surprise is part of the plan , that still leaves the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 , Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the global economic crisis that began in 2008 -LRB- and was aggravated by Greece 's recent financial collapse -RRB- and the earthquake in Haiti in January . In all these cases , observers recognized the existence of catastrophic risk but deemed it to be small . Many other risks like this are lying in wait , whether a lethal flu epidemic , widespread extinctions , nuclear accidents , abrupt global warming that causes a sudden and catastrophic rise in sea levels , or a collision with an asteroid . Why are we so ill prepared for these disasters ? God spoke to Moses through a burning bush on Mount Horeb . He apparently speaks to Republicans through a spewing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Rep. Tom Cole -LRB- R - Okla . -RRB- delivered the startling revelation last week that the BP oil spill was caused not by a faulty blowout preventer but by the Almighty Himself . In gulf oil spill 's long reach , ecological damage could last decades Snorkeling along a coral reef near Veracruz , Mexico , in 2002 , Texas biologist Wes Tunnell spotted what looked like a ledge of rock covered in sand , shells , algae and hermit crabs . He knew , from years of research at the reef , that it probably was n't a rock at all . He stabbed it with his diving knife . His blade pulled up gunk . ` ` Sure enough , it was tar from the Ixtoc spill , '' Tunnell said . U.S. consumers are venting frustration over the BP oil spill , demonstrating at gas stations and corporate offices , drumming up support on Facebook and waging a mock public relations campaign on Twitter . But their opposition to BP 's handling of the crisis has yet to achieve critical mass , and any attempt to dissuade customers from fueling their cars with BP is likely to hurt the small - business owners who run the stations and have little or no effect on the British oil giant 's revenue . Most Americans -- seven out of 10 -- say BP has done a poor or only fair job in handling the April 20 well blowout and spill in the Gulf of Mexico , according to the Pew Research Center , which tracks public opinion . The Obama administration received slightly better marks , with 57 percent rating the government 's response poor or only fair . In light of this discontent , BP may have trouble charging a premium price at the pump for its products , said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service . An intriguing aspect of the BP oil spill is that , before the accident , deepwater drilling seemed to be a technological triumph . About 80 percent of the Gulf of Mexico 's recent oil production has come from deepwater operations , defined as water depths exceeding 1,000 feet . In 1996 , that was 20 percent . Jack - up rigs , which are oil platforms on stilts in a few hundred feet of water , have given way to the ` ` mobile offshore drilling unit '' -LRB- MODU -RRB- . It keeps its position through the interaction of global positioning satellites and on - board engines that activate directional propellers to offset ocean currents and wind . '' This Story : Read + | Watch + | A series of internal investigations over the past decade warned senior BP managers that the oil company repeatedly disregarded safety and environmental rules and risked a serious accident if it did not change its ways . The confidential inquiries , which have not previously been made public , focused on a rash of problems at BP 's Alaska oil - drilling operations . They described instances in which management flouted safety by neglecting aging equipment , pressured employees not to report problems and cut short or delayed inspections to reduce production costs .

Cleaning up the BP spill While the technology required to drill an oil well in deep water can be mind - boggling , cleaning up spilled oilrequires mostly tedious manual labor . No grand vacuum for tar balls has been created ; workers in disposable coveralls pick them up by hand . BP has no marsh hoses ; men in waders wipe sticky oil off dying grass one handful at a time .

View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . In 1969 , when people still used manual typewriters and rotary telephones , a Union Oil well blew out five miles off the coast of Santa Barbara , Calif. . People attacked the oil washing ashore by skimming it off the surface , dispersing it with chemicals , and soaking it up with straw and other materials . Forty - one years and many generations of technology later , BP is attacking the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico with techniques similar to those used in Santa Barbara . And just as in those days , choppy water and strong winds can make it impossible to use those tools to bottle up oil once it has leaked into open seas .

No one knows , but with each day that the leaking oil well a mile below the surface remains uncapped , scientists and energy industry observers are imagining outcomes that range from bad to worse to worst , with some forecasting a calamity of historic proportions . Executives from oil giant BP and other energy companies , meanwhile , shared their own worst - case scenario in a Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers , saying that if they fail to close the well , the spill could increase from an estimated 5,000 barrels a day to 40,000 barrels or possibly even 60,000 barrels .

Wednesday , May 5 , 2010 ; 12:54 PM BP said Wednesday that it has capped one of the three leaks in the pipe from the damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , but the company said that while doing so would simplify the problems on the sea floor it would not alter the rate at which crude oil is spilling into the gulf . The leak was the one farthest from the wellhead , coming from the end of the drill pipe that had collapsed to the seabed . Using robotic submarines , technicians at the surface were able to saw off the end of the drill pipe and install a valve that shut the flow of oil , said BP spokesman Bill Salvin . ` ` We feel great about sealing that leak .

The Interior Department exempted BP 's calamitous Gulf of Mexico drilling operation from a detailed environmental impact analysis last year , according to government documents , after three reviews of the area concluded that a massive oil spill was unlikely . Now , environmentalists and some key senators are calling for a reassessment of safety requirements for offshore drilling . Sen. Judd Gregg -LRB- R - N.H. -RRB- , who has supported offshore oil drilling in the past , said , ` ` I suspect you 're going to see an entirely different regime once people have a chance to sit back and take a look at how do we anticipate and clean up these potential environmental consequences '' from drilling .

The battle against the giant Gulf of Mexico oil slick gained traction Wednesday , even as officials raced to prepare for a sudden course shift that could push the thick gunk into the shipping channel of the Mississippi River . Two weeks into the crisis that began with an explosion on the rig Deepwater Horizon , robotic submarines sealed one of three leaks on the sea bottom . The mile - deep plumbing fix did not diminish the amount of oil flowing from the blown - out well , but it simplified the next step in the emergency response . That step involves what has been called a containment dome . BP is getting more political , and that may help weather oil - spill storm John Browne , the former chief executive of energy giant BP , used to brag about his company 's relative lack of political involvement , saying the London - based conglomerate purposely shied away from spending too much on lobbying and campaign contributions . But since Tony Hayward took over as CEO in 2007 , BP has increased its spending on U.S. politics , a move that may help the firm weather the political storm over its devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The company has mobilized a massive Washington lobbying campaign over the past week in response to the worsening crisis , dispatching senior executives to meet with Obama administration officials and members of Congress , while Hayward and other executives make frequent media appearances to defend BP 's performance . The onslaught underscores the expanding political role of BP , which has spent nearly $ 20 million on Washington lobbying since January 2009 and now ranks second only to ConocoPhillips within the powerful oil and gas industry , according to lobbying disclosure data .

The catastrophic oil spill unfolding in the gulf has provided the environmental community with a rare opportunity to shift public opinion on climate and energy issues , an opening on which it has been quick to capitalize . National environmental groups -- including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Fund -- have rushed volunteers and scientific experts to the Gulf of Mexico to help with the cleanup in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon rig 's collapse .

['– A mile below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, a mile below the surface, a mile below the surface—and one mile below the surface. That\'s the distance between BP\'s latest attempt to contain the oil spill and the one-mile-deep leak that has been leaking since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded two weeks ago, reports the Washington Post. Robotic submarines yesterday saw off the pipe that was leaking and installed a shutoff valve, but BP says that won\'t do much to reduce the amount of oil being spilled. "We feel great about sealing that leak," a BP spokesman told the Los Angeles Times. "But it\'s not going to significantly reduce the amount of oil being spilled."']
HOUSTON -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Sunday that ` ` I am angry and I am frustrated '' that BP has not been able to seal its blown - out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . ` ` We are 33 days into this effort , and deadline after deadline has been missed , '' he told reporters after visiting BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . ` ` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately .

'' Republicans escalate criticism of oil spill response Tuesday , May 25 , 2010 ; 6:20 PM Republican criticism of President Obama 's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is escalating , as lawmakers grow increasingly frustrated with what has so far proved an unstoppable flow . Members of both parties say they are alarmed by the unfolding crisis , but Republicans are upping the ante by questioning whether the Obama administration is doing enough to shut down the gushing underwater well and to contain the resulting environmental damage . ` ` Today is Day 36 '' since the well 's drilling rig exploded , Sen.

The federal agency responsible for regulating U.S. offshore oil drilling repeatedly ignored warnings from government scientists about environmental risks in its push to approve energy exploration activities quickly , according to numerous documents and interviews . Minerals Management Service officials , who can receive cash bonuses in the thousands of dollars based in large part on meeting federal deadlines for leasing offshore oil and gas exploration , frequently changed documents and bypassed legal requirements aimed at protecting the marine environment , the documents show . This has dramatically weakened the scientific checks on offshore drilling that were established under landmark laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the National Environmental Policy Act , say those who have worked with the MMS , which is part of the Interior Department . ` ` It 's a war between the biologists and the engineers , '' said Thomas A. Campbell , who served as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's general counsel under President George H.W. Bush . Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions . The tenuous alliance among the Obama administration , the oil firm BP and Gulf Coast officials was visibly fraying on Monday , with exasperation on all sides mounting as oil from a deep - water gusher began lapping at the region 's environmentally fragile shoreline . Meanwhile , the administration faced growing questions about whether it should be taking more control of the situation , rather than ceding so much of the decision - making about stopping the oil spill to the company that created it . On the coast , local officials complained that Washington has been too slow in helping them hold back the oil . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -LRB- R -RRB- said that the administration has not provided enough equipment -- including booms , skimmers , vacuums and barges -- and that it has stood in the way of his proposal to erect artificial barrier islands . Wednesday , May 26 , 2010 ; 4:26 PM As his administration comes under increasing criticism for its handling of the spreading environmental catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico , President Obama will hold a White House news conference Thursday , his first since February , in an attempt to retake command of the message . He 'll do so as the crisis reaches yet another moment of high risk , both in the Gulf and in Washington . At the scene of the oil spill , the oil firm BP -- attempting the latest of inventive but thus far ineffective maneuvers to stop the gusher that has been spewing from the gulf floor for five weeks -- has begun to pour 50,000 barrels of dense mud into the well . The exercise , known as a '' top kill , '' has effectively stopped other spills in the past but has never been tried at the mile - down depth of this one . Meanwhile , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is scheduled to deliver the results of a review demanded by Obama that gives an accounting of the federal government 's policies with regard to energy exploration on the outer continental shelf , including whether there are adequate safeguards with respect to regulations and inspections . With President Obama under increasing pressure to respond more forcefully to the Gulf Coast oil spill as the environmental devastation mounts , he is expected to order on Thursday strengthened inspections for offshore drilling operations , a U.S. official said Wednesday night . Obama will also travel to Louisiana on Friday , the White House said . He will get an update on the oil spill response and cleanup and will meet with residents who have been personally affected by the oil gushing from a damaged undersea well head , officials said .

Lawmakers unloaded about their concerns during a hearing by the House Natural Resources Committee on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The hearing followed the release of a memorandum by another panel , the House Energy and Commerce Committee , that described an internal BP investigation into the Gulf oil spill .

Oil execs in Senate hearing as gulf oil spill cleanup efforts continue -- photos Oil companies stress one another 's failures in a Senate hearing as cleanup and containment efforts continue in the Gulf of Mexico , after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig April 20 . Three major oil industry executives agreed on one thing in a pair of Senate hearings Tuesday : Someone else was to blame for the drilling rig accident that triggered the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The senior executives from the oil behemoth BP , the offshore oil drilling company Transocean and the oilfield services contractor Halliburton pointed fingers at each other in seeking to explain what caused the accident that set afire and sank the Deepwater Horizon rig , killing 11 people . Getting to the bottom of the accident took center stage for a day even as BP and federal agencies sought to contain or stop the three - week - old oil spill . BP blamed the failure of Transocean 's blowout preventer and raised a new question about whether Transocean disregarded ` ` anomalous pressure test readings '' just hours before the explosion . Three weeks ago , an oil rig far off the coast of Louisiana was hit with a sudden , massive explosion and sank in water a mile deep . Since then , no one has been able to stop the flow of oil into the clear waters . Nearly 4 million gallons of oil have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . If the nonstop efforts to stop it are not successful soon , it could become the nation 's worst oil spill . In 1989 , a leaking oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons along the coast of Alaska .

A House energy panel investigation has found that the blowout preventer that failed to stop a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico had a dead battery in its control pod , leaks in its hydraulic system , a ` ` useless '' test version of a key component and a cutting tool that was n't strong enough to shear through steel joints in the well pipe and stop the flow of oil . In a devastating review of the blowout preventer , which BP said was supposed to be ` ` fail - safe , '' Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D - Mich . -RRB- , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's subcommittee on oversight , said Wednesday that documents and interviews show that the device was anything but . The comments came in a hearing in which lawmakers grilled senior executives from BP and oilfield service firms Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron , maker of the blowout preventer . For nearly three weeks , the world has been hearing about the leaking well on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Now there 's video footage , and it 's not pretty , showing a turbulent plume of oil and gas billowing from the end of a 21-inch pipe that dropped to the mud floor of the gulf after the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . But the new video clips do n't clarify one of the biggest unknowns : How much oil are we looking at ? The experts say emphatically that anyone who makes an estimate of the leak by looking at the video is simply arm - waving . There are too many variables . Within hours of the massive April 20 explosion on Deepwater Horizon , the U.S. government launched an urgent and carefully managed response to demonstrate its control of the emerging disaster , sending Coast Guard ships to the site , keeping the president informed and posting projections of how an oil spill might affect travel . What the Obama administration did not realize was how the arcane world of offshore drilling would collide with official Washington as politicians began kibitzing about rig mechanisms on Sunday talk shows and oil executives gave daily briefings about their disaster - management skills . The administration probably had no idea that it would find itself in many ways dependent on a foreign oil company -- both foe and needed friend in the response . It was a relationship for which neither the White House nor BP was well prepared . And it stands in contrast to the arm 's - length distance that the U.S. government kept from Exxon after the Valdez spill in 1989 .

Gulf oil spill 's animal victims As BP works to control the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , local wildlife struggle for survival . '' Friday , May 21 , 2010 ; 8:38 PM Crews looking for injured or dead wildlife in the vast Gulf of Mexico oil spill have found a few more of them -- but they fear that many animals and fish might be dying offshore and unnoticed . In a conference call with reporters Friday morning , officials from several federal agencies listed the animals injured so far . Forty - three birds have been found dead from oil in the gulf , and 23 found ` ` oiled '' but alive . That number is up slightly from a few days ago . Authorities have also found 186 sea turtles , most of them dead . Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad W. Allen will continue to serve as President Obama 's point man on the Gulf Coast oil spill after he retires this month , the administration said Thursday . Obama tapped Allen last month to be national incident commander when he labeled the spill an ` ` incident of national significance . '' Such incidents -- usually a natural disaster or terrorist attack -- require the president to appoint a federal official to coordinate the government 's response . Allen is set to be relieved of his other duties by Adm. Robert J. Papp Jr. by the end of May , but Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Thursday that he will continue to serve as national incident commander . Oil spill map : What 's at stake ?

The agreement was the subject of a letter , obtained by The Washington Post , written by rig owner Transocean and signed by a BP representative .

Friday , May 28 , 2010 ; 5:21 PM Federal health officials Friday called on BP to protect the health of workers cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico and residents living along the coast and outlined steps the government was taking to respond to any physical and mental health problems that emerge from the disaster . The announcement came in response to scattered reports of illnesses among cleanup workers and some residents , which has prompted criticism from members of Congress , local activist groups and independent scientists that not enough was being done . ` ` We 're very concerned about the impact of disaster on the public health of people in gulf region , '' said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , adding that she had sent a letter to BP Chairman Lamar McKay urging the company ` ` to take responsibility for the health consequences of the disaster . '' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is monitoring poison centers and other reporting systems for signs of any emerging medical problems , Sebelius said . The Environmental Protection Agency had tested more than 15,000 air samples from Venice , La. , to Pensacola , Fla. , and had not yet not yet detected dangerous substances at hazardous levels , she said . Explore all of our oil spill graphics to track the spill , see its effects , and learn its possible solutions . BP is coming in for plenty of abuse these days , and certainly much of it is deserved . Mistakes made by BP officials , or contractors and suppliers they engaged and supervised , led to a preventable explosion that killed 11 people and unleashed an environmental disaster of immense but still unknown proportion . Compounding those initial mistakes has been a failure to anticipate such a disaster and have an adequate response plan in place . It is now clear that the ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico has been badly damaged , perhaps irreparably , affecting the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the region . Here 's my question : Why were we drilling in 5,000 feet of water in the first place ? Many reasons , but this one goes unmentioned : Environmental chic has driven us out there . As production from the shallower Gulf of Mexico wells declines , we go deep -LRB- 1,000 feet and more -RRB- and ultra deep -LRB- 5,000 feet and more -RRB- , in part because environmentalists have succeeded in rendering the Pacific and nearly all the Atlantic coast off - limits to oil production . -LRB- Just a few minutes into his comments about the damage from the gulf oil leak to the House Energy Committee on Thursday , Louisiana congressman Charlie Melancon was overcome . ` ` Our culture is threatened , our coastal economy is threatened , and everything that I know and love is at risk , '' he said . He sighed deeply and paused to gather himself . ` ` Even though this marsh lies along coastal Louisiana , these are America 's wetlands , '' he continued , before he had to stop and abruptly leave the room . Right after the spill , Jeremy Symons , a senior vice president at the National Wildlife Federation , toured the gulf and saw dolphins playing in the boat 's wake . BP 's three - day effort to throttle the leaking gulf oil well with multiple blasts of heavy mud has failed . The attempted ` ` top kill '' of the well was abandoned late Saturday afternoon , leaving the huge Macondo field deep beneath the sea floor once again free to pump at least half a million gallons of crude a day into the gulf . ` ` I can say we tried . But what I can also say is this scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , or have n't succeeded in that so far , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said in a late - day news conference . ` ` There 's no silver bullet to stop this leak , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . A timeline of BP 's attempts to stop the flow of oil SOURCE : SOURCES : BP , U.S. Coast Guard | The Washington Post - May 30 , 2010 The Post asked experts about the political winners and losers of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Below are contributions from Ed Rogers , Scott Keeter , Douglas E. Schoen and Donna Brazile . White House staffer to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ; chairman of BGR Group So far there are no political winners from the gulf oil spill debacle . And there probably wo n't be any winners , just various degrees of losers .
['– BP\'s latest attempt to plug its gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico didn\'t work out so well, and the Obama administration is taking the unusual step of urging the company to take full responsibility for the health consequences of the spill, reports the Washington Post. Kathleen Sebelius told BP\'s chairman in a letter that the government is "very concerned about the impact of disaster on the public health of people in the Gulf region," and that the CDC is monitoring poison centers and other reporting systems for signs of possible health problems among cleanup workers and Gulf residents.']
